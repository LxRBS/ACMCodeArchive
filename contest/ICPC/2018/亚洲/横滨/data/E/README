There may be diverse valid output for the problem E.
The files *.ans in this directory give one of the varieties.

A program is thus provided for judging output validity.
The source program of the validator is in the file "check_E.cc".

You can compile and run the program specifying the following arguments.
   # check_E <input file> <judges' answer file> <message directory> < <your answer file>
The first two arguments should be the file-names in this directory.
You can specify any directory name as <message directory>.  Your answer
should be given through the standard input.

When your answer contains incorrect output for the specified input,
the program writes out messages pointing out the error it found to the
file <message directory>/judgemessage.txt, and then exits with code 43.
Otherwise, when the answer is acceptable, it will exit with code 42
without any message output.
