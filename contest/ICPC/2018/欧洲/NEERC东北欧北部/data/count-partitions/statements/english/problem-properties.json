Barney's older sister Cecilia often watches him play with his set of cubes. She also joins Barney in his games and prevails most of the time, shaking his confidence on a daily basis.\r\n\r\nOne day Cecilia noticed Barney struggling to build a \\textit{symmetric stair} with his $n$ cubes. She immediately told him she could not just build a symmetric stair, but even calculate the number of different symmetric stairs consisting of $n$ cubes! Can you?\r\n\r\nRecall that a \\textit{symmetric stair} consists of one or more towers of cubes, where the heights of towers are \\textit{non-increasing} from left to right, and is symmetric with respect to the $x = y$ line (where the $x$-axis is horizontal and oriented to the right, and the $y$-axis is vertical and oriented upwards). For a more detailed explanation, please refer to problem B statement.\r\n\r\nThe number of different symmetric stairs can be quite large, so you need to calculate it modulo $998\\,244\\,353$.","authorLogin":"avasilyev","language":"english","timeLimit":3000,"output":"For each test case, output a line with a single integer~--- the number of symmetric stairs with exactly $n_i$ cubes, modulo $998\\,244\\,353$.","inputFile":"stdin","outputFile":"stdout","input":"The input contains multiple test cases.\r\n\r\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer $t$~--- the number of test cases ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$).
