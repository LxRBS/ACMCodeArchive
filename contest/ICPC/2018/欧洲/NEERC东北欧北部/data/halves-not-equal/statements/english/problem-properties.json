{"scoring":null,"notes":"","legend":"The king died and his gold had to be divided among his $n$ wives. He had not left his will about the parts of his wives, so they started arguing. The $i$-th wife claimed that she should get $a_i$ dinars.\r\n\r\nHowever, it turned out that the total property of the king was only $s$ dinars, and $s \\le a_1 + a_2 + \\ldots + a_n$. A wise man was called to help divide the king's inheritance. But he said that he only knew a fair way to divide gold between two persons.\r\n\r\nThe \\textit{fair way} is the following. Without loss of generality, let the claims of the two persons be $a_1 \\le a_2$, and let there be $b$ dinars of gold to be divided, $0 \\le b \\le a_1 + a_2$. If $b \\le a_1$, each of the persons would get $b/2$ dinars. If $a_1 < b < a_2$, the first one would get $a_1/2$ dinars and the second one would get $b - a_1/2$ dinars. Finally, if $a_2 \\le b$, the first one would get $a_1/2 + (b - a_2) / 2$ and the second one would get $a_2/2 + (b - a_1) / 2$. Gold can be divided to any fractional part, so the amount one gets can be fractional. Note that the amount each one would get is a monotonic and continuous function of $b$.\r\n\r\nNow you have been called as an even wiser person to help divide the gold among the $n$ wives.\r\nEach wife should get no more than she claims. The division is called fair if for any two wives who claim $a_i$ and $a_j$ dinars of the inheritance and get $c_i$ and $c_j$ dinars, correspondingly, these values are the \\textit{fair way} to divide $c_i + c_j$ dinars between them.\r\n\r\nHelp the wives of the late king divide his inheritance.","authorLogin":"andrewzta","language":"english","timeLimit":3000,"output":"Output $n$ floating point numbers $c_1, c_2, \\ldots, c_n$~--- the amounts of gold each wife should get in a fair division.\r\n\r\nFor each pair of wives $i$ and $j$ the absolute or relative difference between their parts and their parts in the \\textit{fair way} to divide $c_i + c_j$ between them must not exceed $10^{-9}$.
