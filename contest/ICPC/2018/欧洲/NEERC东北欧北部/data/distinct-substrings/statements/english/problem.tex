\begin{problem}{Distinct Substrings}{standard input}{standard output}{3 seconds}{512 megabytes}

Diana bought a Long Random String Generator on some weird website. She planned to generate a long string $s$ of length $n$ and then use its contiguous substrings as passwords for other weird websites.

Soon she discovered that the generated string $s$ of length $n$ was not random at all, but rather a string $p$ of length $k$ repeated many times and then cut to length $n$. Thus, $s[i] = p[i \bmod k]$ for all $i$ from $0$ to $n-1$.

Diana wonders how many different passwords she can get from the generated string. Help her find the number of distinct non-empty substrings in string $s$.


\InputFile
The first line of the input contains a string $p$ consisting of $k$ lowercase English letters ($1\le k\le 1000$).

The second line contains an integer $n$ ($k\le n\le 10^9$).

\OutputFile
Output the number of distinct non-empty substrings in $s$.

\Examples

\begin{example}
\exmp{abba
7
}{20
}%
\exmp{a
42
}{42
}%
\end{example}

\Note
In the first example, the generated string is \t{abbaabb}. It contains 20 distinct non-empty substrings: \t{a}, \t{b}, \t{aa}, \t{ab}, \t{ba}, \t{bb}, \t{aab}, \t{abb}, \t{baa}, \t{bba}, \t{aabb}, \t{abba}, \t{baab}, \t{bbaa}, \t{abbaa}, \t{baabb}, \t{bbaab}, \t{abbaab}, \t{bbaabb}, \t{abbaabb}.
