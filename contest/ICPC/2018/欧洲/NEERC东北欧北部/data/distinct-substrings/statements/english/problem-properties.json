She planned to generate a long string $s$ of length $n$ and then use its contiguous substrings as passwords for other weird websites.\r\n\r\nSoon she discovered that the generated string $s$ of length $n$ was not random at all, but rather a string $p$ of length $k$ repeated many times and then cut to length $n$. Thus, $s[i] = p[i \\bmod k]$ for all $i$ from $0$ to $n-1$.\r\n\r\nDiana wonders how many different passwords she can get from the generated string.
