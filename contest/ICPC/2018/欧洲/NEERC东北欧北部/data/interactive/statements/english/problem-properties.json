{"scoring":null,"notes":"","legend":"This is an interactive problem.\r\n\r\nJury has prepared $n$ non-empty integer arrays $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$. Each array consists of at most 10 positive integers not exceeding 1000. The elements of each array are pairwise distinct.\r\n\r\nYou can make queries of the following kind: choose several indices $q_1, q_2, \\ldots, q_m$, where $1 \\le m \\le n$ and $1 \\le q_i \\le n$. These indices do not have to be distinct. The testing system tells you the contents of arrays $a_{q_1}, a_{q_2}, \\ldots, a_{q_m}$ in the same order. However, these contents are concatenated without any delimeters.\r\n\r\nYour task is to find the contents of all $n$ arrays.","authorLogin":"qwerty787788","language":"english","timeLimit":3000,"output":"","inputFile":"stdin","outputFile":"stdout","input":"","authorName":"Borys Minaiev","sampleTests":[{"output":"~\r\n? 3 1 2 3\r\n~\r\n? 3 1 3 1\r\n~\r\n? 1 2\r\n~\r\n! 1 1 2 1 2 2 2 1","input":"3\r\n~\r\n5 1 1 2 2 1\r\n~\r\n4 1 2 1 1\r\n~\r\n2 1 2"}],"name":"Interactive Array Guessing","interaction":"First, the testing system writes the integer $n$~--- the number of arrays ($1 \\leq n \\leq 1000$).\r\n\r\nYour solution shall print requests of two types:\r\n\\begin{itemize}\r\n\\item ``\\t{? }$m\\ q_1\\ q_2\\ \\ldots\\ q_m$'' corresponds to a query about the contents of arrays $a_{q_1}, a_{q_2}, \\ldots, a_{q_m}$. The testing system responds with the total length of these arrays, followed by the contents of array $a_{q_1}$, followed by the contents of array $a_{q_2}$, $\\ldots$, followed by the contents of array $a_{q_m}$.\r\n\\item ``\\t{! }$k_1\\ a_{1, 1}\\ \\ldots\\ a_{1, k_1}\\ \\ldots\\ k_n\\ a_{n, 1}\\ \\ldots\\ a_{n, k_n}$'' tells that your program has determined the contents of all the arrays, where $k_i$ is the length of array $a_i$. The request is formed by the length of array $a_1$, followed by the contents of array $a_1$, followed by the length of array $a_2$, followed by the contents of array $a_2$, $\\ldots$, followed by the length of array $a_n$, followed by the contents of array $a_n$.\r\n\\end{itemize}\r\n\r\nDon't forget to flush the output after each request!\r\n\r\nYour solution must issue exactly one request of the second type.
