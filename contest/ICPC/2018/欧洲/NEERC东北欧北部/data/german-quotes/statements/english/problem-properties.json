{"scoring":null,"notes":"","legend":"German language uses conventional angular quote marks (`<<' and `>>'), so one may quote \r\ntext in a <<conventional>> way. \r\nWhat is unconventional in German is that one may also quote text in a >>reversed<< way.\r\nIn normal life these styles do not mix, since they are used in different \r\nGerman-speaking countries. \r\nBut let us have some fun! If we merge these two typographical traditions and forget about rules for nested quotes (that is, if we allow unlimited nesting), we will receive Generalized German rules that allow us to write small quotation masterpieces like this:\r\n\r\n\\begin{center}\r\n<<>>Anf√ºhrungszeichen<< means <<quote marks>> in German>>\r\n\\end{center}\r\n\r\nInformally we will say that a string is a correct quotation if it can be obtained by removing all non-quote characters from a correctly formed Generalized German text. Formally:\r\n\r\n$$\\langle G \\rangle ::= \\varepsilon\\ |\\ \\langle G \\rangle \\langle G \\rangle\\ |\\ \r\n\\textrm{`<<'} \\langle G \\rangle \\textrm{`>>'}\\ |\\ \\textrm{`>>'} \\langle G \\rangle \\textrm{`<<'}$$\r\n\r\n%$$ G ::= \\varepsilon\\ |\\ G G \\ |\\ \r\n%\\textrm{<<} G \\textrm{>>}\\ |\\ \\textrm{>>} G \\textrm{<<}$$\r\n\r\nThus, a correct quotation is an empty string, a concatenation of two correct quotations, or a correct quotation quoted in either a conventional or a reversed way. In the latter case, we will say that the quote mark to the left of $\\langle G \\rangle$ is a \\textit{starting} quote, and the quote mark to the right of $\\langle G \\rangle$ is an \\textit{ending} quote. For example, in quotation string `<<>>' the quote mark `<<' is a starting quote, while in string `>><<' the same quote mark `<<' is an ending quote.\r\n\r\nYour task is to check whether the given string is a correct quotation, and if it is, restore its structure~--- that is, replace all starting quote marks with `\\verb![!' and all ending quote marks with `\\verb!]!'.\r\n","authorLogin":"dshtuk","language":"english","timeLimit":3000,"output":"If the input string is a correct quotation, replace all starting quote marks with `\\verb![!', all ending quote marks with `\\verb!]!', and output the result.
