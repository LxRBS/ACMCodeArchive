\begin{problem}{Building a Stair}{standard input}{standard output}{3 seconds}{512 megabytes}

Little Barney just got a new toy cube set from his parents. His set contains $n$ identical cubes. Barney immediately started building various objects with these cubes.

The latest thing Barney built is a \textit{stair}. A stair consists of one or more towers of cubes, where the heights of towers are \textit{non-increasing} from left to right. In the following picture, you can see three different shapes with $12$ cubes each. The first two are stairs and the third one is not a stair.

Barney noticed that for some stairs you can turn your head 90 degrees to the right and you will see the same stair, but reversed! He calls such stairs \textit{symmetric}. For example, the first stair above is symmetric, but the second one is not. Formally, a stair is symmetric if and only if when you reflect the picture over the $x = y$ line, you get the same stair (where the $x$-axis is horizontal and oriented to the right, and the $y$-axis is vertical and oriented upwards).

Barney wants to build a symmetric stair using all of his $n$ cubes. Show him how to do it!

\InputFile
The single line of the input contains an integer $n$~--- the number of cubes at Barney's disposal ($1 \le n \le 100$).

\OutputFile
If there is no symmetric stair with $n$ cubes, output a single integer $-1$.

Otherwise, in the first line, output one integer $m$~--- the number of rows and columns in the picture of the stair ($1 \le m \le 100$). Then, output $m$ lines describing the stair. Each line must contain exactly $m$ characters `\texttt{o}' (a lowercase English letter) or `\texttt{.}', where `\texttt{o}' describes a cell with a cube, and `\texttt{.}' describes an empty cell. There must be exactly $n$ `\texttt{o}' characters in total. The cell in the bottom left corner must contain a cube. If there is more than one solution, output any of them.
