\problemname {Math Trade}

Suppose a group of people have objects they want to trade, and objects they want to get in return:

\begin {tabular} {c c c}
  Name & Has & Wants \\
  \hline
  Sally & Clock & Doll \\
  Steve & Doll & Painting \\
  Carlos & Painting & Clock \\
  Maria & Candlestick & Vase \\

  \hline

\end {tabular}

Notice how none of the people listed can pair off and trade with each other.  However, if Sally, Steve, and Carlos all got together, Sally could trade her clock to Steve for the Doll she wants, and Steve can then trade that clock to Carlos for the painting he wants.

This creation of a chain of individual trades that gets a large number of people (Sadly, not everyone.  Poor Maria.) the objects they want is called a math trade.  The object is to create the single chain of the longest length

\section*{Input}

Each input instance will begin with an integer $n$, the number of people interested in trading.  There will then follow $n$ lines, each with three strings separated by spaces.  The first string will be the name of the trader.  The second string will be the object the trader has.  The third string will be the object the trader wants.

\section*{Output}
Output the number of items in the longest sequential trade of items that results in each trader giving up the item they have and getting the item they want.
