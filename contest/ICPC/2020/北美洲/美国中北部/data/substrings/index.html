      <h1>Substring Characters</h1>

      <h3>Problem ID: substrings</h3>
    </div>

    <p>The set of distinct characters in a string is referred to as
    the generalized period of the string. As an example, the
    generalized period of the string “<tt class="tt">aabbabb</tt>”
    is {‘<tt class="tt">a</tt>’,‘<tt class="tt">b</tt>’}</p>

    <p>A proper substring is a contiguous substring that is
    contained in a string and is not the string itself. So
    “<tt class="tt">aabbabb</tt>” is not a proper substring of the
    above example.</p>

    <p>A minimal proper substring is one that can have no character
    removed from either end and still have the same generalized
    period. “<tt class="tt">aabb</tt>” is a proper substring of the
    example, but it is not minimal. “<tt class="tt">ab</tt>” is
    minimal.</p>

    <p>Unique means that multiple occurrences of the same minimal
    proper substring in a string are only to be counted once. In
    the example, “<tt class="tt">ab</tt>” appears twice, but is
    counted once—hence the number of proper minimal unique
    substrings with the same generalized period of the entire
    string is two: “<tt class="tt">ab</tt>” and “<tt class=
    "tt">ba</tt>”.</p>

    <p>Your team is to write a program to count the number of
    proper minimal unique substrings of a given string that have
    the same generalized period as the string itself.</p>

    <h2>Input</h2>

    <p>Input to your program is a series of lines terminated by
    end-of-file. Each line is a test case consisting of
    alphanumeric characters (a–z, A–Z, 0–9). Upper-case and
    lower-case letters are distinct. The new line character is not
    part of the test case string. No test case string will exceed
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$80$</span> characters.</p>

    <h2>Output</h2>

    <p>For each input line print a line containing the number of
    proper minimal unique substrings of the input string with no
    leading or trailing whitespace and no extra leading signs or
    zeros.</p>
