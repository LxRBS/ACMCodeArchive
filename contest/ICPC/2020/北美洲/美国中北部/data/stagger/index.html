      <h1>Staggering to the Finish</h1>

      <h3>Problem ID: stagger</h3>
    </div>

    <p>An oval track and field racing track consists of two
    parallel straightaway sections connected by two semicircles,
    depicted in Figure&nbsp;1. Footraces run in the
    counterclockwise direction, ending at a common finish line
    located along the lower straightaway. For races that exceed the
    length of a single straightaway, starting lines must be
    staggered backwards, in the clockwise direction, from the
    finish line. The staggered starting lines must account for the
    curve of the semicircles and the widths of each running
    lane.</p>

    <p>There are international standards for oval track dimensions.
    Unfortunately, the available area for a track doesn’t always
    hold a standard track. Given the dimensions of the track and
    the length of the race, your team is to write a program to
    ensure equal race lengths by computing the staggered starting
    line positions.</p>

    <p>The total distance of a race for any given lane is computed
    from the <i class="sl">line of running</i>. The line of running
    is an unmarked line to the right of the lane’s inside marker
    (as seen from the counterclockwise direction). See
    Figure&nbsp;2. For the innermost lane (lane 1) the line of
    running is usually farther from the lane marker than for the
    remaining lanes.</p>

    <p>The track is mapped to an <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x,
    y)$</span> coordinate system with <span class=
    "tex2jax_process">$(0, 0)$</span> at the center of the track.
    See Figure 1.</p>

    <h2>Input</h2>

    <p>The first line of input to your program contains seven
    values, <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> <span class=
    "tex2jax_process">$R$</span> <span class=
    "tex2jax_process">$S$</span> <span class=
    "tex2jax_process">$W$</span> <span class=
    "tex2jax_process">$F$</span> <span class=
    "tex2jax_process">$L_1$</span> <span class=
    "tex2jax_process">$L_2$</span>, separated by whitespace,
    describing the geometry of a track, where:</p>

    <ul class="itemize">
      <li>
        <p><span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> is the integer
        number of lanes. (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le N
        \le 9$</span>)</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p><span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span> is the inner
        radius of lane 1, a real number in meters. See
        Figure&nbsp;1. (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1.0 \le R
        \le 100.0$</span>)</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p><span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> is the length
        of the straightaway, a real number in meters. See
        Figure&nbsp;1. (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1.0 \le S
        \le 200.0$</span>)</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p><span class="tex2jax_process">$W$</span> is the width of
        each lane, a real number in meters. See Figure&nbsp;2.
        (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0.5 \le W \le
        3.0$</span>)</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p><span class="tex2jax_process">$F$</span> is the
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>-coordinate of the
        finish line, measured from the centerline in Figure&nbsp;1,
        a real value in meters. The finish line will always be in
        the lower (negative <span class=
        "tex2jax_process">$y$</span>) half of the track.
        (<span class="tex2jax_process">$\vert F\vert \le S /
        2$</span>)</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p><span class="tex2jax_process">$L_1$</span> is the offset
        from the inner radius of lane&nbsp;1 to the line of running
        for lane&nbsp;1, a real number in meters. See
        Figure&nbsp;2. (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le L_1
        &lt; W$</span>)</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p><span class="tex2jax_process">$L_2$</span> is the offset
        from the inner radius to the lines of running for
        lanes&nbsp;2 and higher. See Figure&nbsp;2. (<span class=
        "tex2jax_process">$0 \le L_2 &lt; W$</span>)</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>The remaining lines until end-of-file specify <span class=
    "tex2jax_process">$D$</span>, the distance of a race, one race
    per line, a real number in meters. (<span class=
    "tex2jax_process">$1.0 \le D &lt; 410.0$</span>)</p>

    <h2>Output</h2>

    <p>Your program is to print a series of values for each race
    distance, separated from each other by spaces and/or newlines.
    Print the race distance first, followed by the <span class=
    "tex2jax_process">$(x, y)$</span> coordinates of the staggered
    starting line locations in lane number order. Express all
    values in meters. The <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x,
    y)$</span> coordinate is the innermost point of a lane, NOT the
    line of running. Treat each lane <i class="sl">marker</i>
    (straightaway or radius) as a zero-width line. International
    standards require that the values be within <span class=
    "tex2jax_process">$0.001$</span> meters of the exact
    answer.</p>
