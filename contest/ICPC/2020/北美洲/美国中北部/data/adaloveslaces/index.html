    <p>A shoe has a lacing geometry: <span class=
    "tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, the number of eyelets (on a
    side), <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span>, the distance
    between eyelets, <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span>, the
    separation between the columns of eyelets when the shoe is
    laced, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span>, the
    thickness of an eyelet. In Figure 1 below, <span class=
    "tex2jax_process">$N = 3$</span>, with eyelets numbered from
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> to <span class=
    "tex2jax_process">$2N - 1$</span>.</p>

        <img src="img-0001.png" alt=

    <p>When laced, a shoelace of length <span class=
    "tex2jax_process">$L$</span> will have two free ends for knot
    tying. The free length of each end is <span class=
    "tex2jax_process">$f$</span>. The length of <span class=
    "tex2jax_process">$f$</span> must fall within a certain range,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$[f_{min}, f_{max}]$</span> to
    accommodate a knot that is neither too small to tie nor so
    large as to dangle. See Figure 2 for a common criss-cross
    pattern.</p>

        <img src="img-0002.png" alt=
        "\includegraphics[width=.32\textwidth ]{LacingPattern.png}"

    </div>

    <p>That special end of a lace that prevents fraying is called
    an “aglet.” You’re welcome.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, shoelaces break at the most inopportune
    times. Before purchasing a new shoelace, it is often necessary
    to retie the shorter, broken lace, or replace it with another
    lace borrowed from another shoe.</p>

    <p>Given <span class="tex2jax_process">$N, d, s, t, f_{min},
    f_{max}$</span>, and a series of replacement shoelace lengths,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span>, for each shoelace
    length determine the number of lacing patterns that leave free
    ends, <span class="tex2jax_process">$f$</span>, such that
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$f_{min} \le f \le
    f_{max}$</span>. The rules of lacing are as follows:</p>

    <ul class="itemize">
      <li>
        <p>The resulting lacing pattern must be symmetric across a
        line drawn vertically between the even-numbered and
        odd-numbered eyelets.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>The lace can only pass through an eyelet at most
        once.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>The lace can only pass between eyelets in the same
        column that are immediately adjacent.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>The free ends of the lace must emerge from eyelet
        numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$2N - 2$</span> and
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$2N - 1$</span>.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>The lace must pass directly between eyelet numbers 0 and
        1 to ensure the shoelace holds the shoe on the foot.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>You are to assume that the surface the eyelets are on is to
    be treated as a plane, that the shoelace passes through the
    center of the eyelets, and that the thickness of the shoelace
    itself is negligible. The total length of the shoelace that is
    used for lacing is the length used between the eyelets plus
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> for each eyelet the
    shoelace passes through. In the example shown in Figure 2,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$6t$</span> of the shoelace
    length is used by passing through the six eyelets.</p>

    <h2>Input</h2>

    <p>The input begins with a single line containing <span class=
    "tex2jax_process">$N, d, s, t, f_{min}, f_{max}$</span>,
    separated by whitespace. Each additional line is a new value of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span> for which your program
    is to count the number of lacing patterns that meet the stated
    requirements. There will be between <span class=
    "tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class=
    "tex2jax_process">$100$</span> values of <span class=
    "tex2jax_process">$L$</span>. All measurements are in integer
    millimeters.</p>

    <p><span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> will be between
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> and <span class=
    "tex2jax_process">$9$</span> inclusive. <span class=
    "tex2jax_process">$d$</span> will be between <span class=
    "tex2jax_process">$5$</span> and <span class=
    "tex2jax_process">$30$</span> inclusive. <span class=
    "tex2jax_process">$s$</span> will be between <span class=
    "tex2jax_process">$10$</span> and <span class=
    "tex2jax_process">$50$</span> inclusive. <span class=
    "tex2jax_process">$t$</span> will be between <span class=
    "tex2jax_process">$0$</span> and <span class=
    "tex2jax_process">$4$</span> inclusive. Shoelace lengths will
    be between <span class="tex2jax_process">$200$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2\, 000$</span> millimeters
    inclusive. <span class="tex2jax_process">$f_{min}$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$f_{max}$</span> will not be
    within a micron (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0.001$</span>
    millimeters) of the free end lengths of a valid lacing
    pattern.</p>

    <h2>Output</h2>

    <p>For each shoelace length, your program is to print the
    number of possible lacing patterns that meet the above
    requirements on a single line with no signs, leading or
    trailing whitespace, or leading zeroes.</p>
