\begin{problem}{Integer Square}{standard input}{standard output}{2 seconds}{512 megabytes}

Iris likes to draw different shapes on a grid paper. Her favorite shape is a square. She has recently tried to draw a square with area $s$, but since she uses a grid paper, she wants all the vertices of the square to have integer coordinates.

Can you help her find such a square?

\InputFile
The input contains a single integer $s$ ($1\le s\le 1000$).

\OutputFile
If it is possible to construct the required square, output four pairs of integers: the coordinates of the vertices of the square, in any order. All coordinates should be in the range from $-10^9$ to $10^9$. If there are multiple answers, output any of them.

If it is impossible to construct the required square, print ``\t{Impossible}''.
