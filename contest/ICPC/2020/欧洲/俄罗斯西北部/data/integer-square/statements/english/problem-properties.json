She has recently tried to draw a square with area $s$, but since she uses a grid paper, she wants all the vertices of the square to have integer coordinates.\r\n\r\n\\begin{center}\r\n\\includegraphics{pic.1}\r\n\\end{center}\r\n\r\nCan you help her find such a square?","authorLogin":"pashka","language":"english","timeLimit":2000,"output":"If it is possible to construct the required square, output four pairs of integers: the coordinates of the vertices of the square, in any order.
