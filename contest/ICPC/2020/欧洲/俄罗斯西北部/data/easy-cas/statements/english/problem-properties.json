{"scoring":null,"notes":"","legend":"Let us define ``Compare-and-Set'' operation for a global variable $v$. The operation checks if the variable is equal to $a$. If that's true, the variable value changes to $b$ and the operation succeeds. Otherwise, the variable doesn't change and the operation fails. Let us denote the operation as $\\operatorname{CAS}(a,b)$.\r\n\r\nImagine that you are given a list of such operations $\\operatorname{CAS}(a_1,b_1), \\dots, \\operatorname{CAS}(a_n,b_n)$. Also, you are given an initial value for the variable, $c$, and a list of wishes $w_1, \\dots w_n$, where $w_i$ tells whether the operation $\\operatorname{CAS}(a_i,b_i)$ should be successful. Your task is to determine the order of operations execution so that all the wishes are satisfied.","authorLogin":"svem","language":"english","timeLimit":2000,"output":"If no correct order of operations exists, output a single word ``\\t{No}''.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, output a word ``\\t{Yes}'' followed by $n$ distinct integers $p_1, p_2, \\ldots p_n$ ($1 \\le p_i \\le n$), meaning that operation $p_1$ should be executed first, then operation $p_2$, and so on. \r\nIf there are several possible orders, output any of them.\r\n","inputFile":"stdin","outputFile":"stdout","input":"The first line contains two integers $n$ and $c$ ($1 \\le n \\le 10^5$; $1 \\le c \\le 10^9$)~--- the number of operations and the initial value of the variable.\r\n\r\nEach of the next $n$ lines contains three integers $a_i, b_i, w_i$ ($1 \\le a_i, b_i \\le 10^9$; $0 \\le w_i \\le 1$), denoting $\\operatorname{CAS}(a_i, b_i)$ operation that you wish to be successful if $w_i = 1$ and unsuccessful if $w_i = 0$.
