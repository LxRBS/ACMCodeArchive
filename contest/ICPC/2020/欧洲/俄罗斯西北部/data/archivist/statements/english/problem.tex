Help the contest archivist to remember the results of each contest and write a program that will read the year and print contest winners of that year in exactly the same format as above.

\InputFile
The only line of input contains a single integer $y$ ($1995 \le y \le 2019$), denoting the year. You don't need to process year numbers less than $1995$ or greater than $2019$, or incorrect year formats. It is guaranteed that you will be given a number between $1995$ and $2019$, inclusive.

\OutputFile
Print the winner of the contest in year $y$ exactly in the same format as in the list above.

\Examples

\begin{example}
\exmpfile{example.01}{example.01.a}%
\exmpfile{example.02}{example.02.a}%
\exmpfile{example.03}{example.03.a}%
\exmpfile{example.04}{example.04.a}%
\end{example}
