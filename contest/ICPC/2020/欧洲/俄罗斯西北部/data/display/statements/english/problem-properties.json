{"scoring":null,"notes":"","legend":"St. Petersburg Supway tests new SupLED ticker displays. The display shows a monochrome sliding text line printed in SupFont. The text is only shown once and does not loop. Each SupFont character has a fixed size of $w \\times h$ pixels, where each pixel is either {\\it on} or {\\it off}. There is a column of {\\it off} pixels between consecutive characters of the text. The text sliding speed is one pixel per tick.\r\n\r\nThe main service life factor is the number of switches: when a pixel turns from {\\it on} to {\\it off} or vice versa. A pixel breaks after $s$ switches. If a pixel's state is not changed between two ticks, no switches occur.\r\n\r\nThe services team needs to estimate the shortest text that causes any of the pixels to break. All pixels are {\\it off} before the text is shown.","authorLogin":"kgeorgiy","language":"english","timeLimit":2000,"output":"Output a single line containing at most $s$ characters: the shortest text that, when shown on a display, causes some pixel to switch at least $s$ times.

The first line of each description contains an ASCII character (only characters with codes between 33 and 126, inclusive, are used). The character's image with $h$ lines of length $w$ follows, `\\texttt{\\#}' denotes an {\\it on} pixel, and `\\texttt{.}' denotes an {\\it off} pixel. Each image has at least one {\\it on} pixel.\r\n\r\nAll described ASCII characters are distinct, but some of them may have the same image.","authorName":"Georgiy Korneev","sampleTests":[{"output":"ICPC","input":"3 4 5 16\r\nI\r\n.#..\r\n#.#.\r\n.#..\r\n.#..\r\n###.\r\nC\r\n.##.\r\n#..#\r\n#...\r\n#..#\r\n.##.\r\nP\r\n###.\r\n#..#\r\n###.\r\n#...\r\n#...\r\n","inputFile":"example.01","outputFile":"example.01.a"}],"name":"Display","interaction":null,"memoryLimit":536870912,"tutorial":""}
