Place a pencil inside the string and draw a curve around the pins, trying to pull the string in every possible direction. The picture below shows an example of a string tied around the pins and pulled by a pencil (a point $P$).\r\n\r\n\\begin{center}\r\n\\includegraphics{stmtfig.pdf}\r\n\\end{center}\r\n\r\nYour task is to find an area inside this curve. Formally, for a given convex polygon $S$ and a length $l$ let's define a \\emph{fiber shape} $F(S, l)$ as a set of points $t$ such that the perimeter of the convex hull of $S \\cup \\{t\\}$ does not exceed $l$.
