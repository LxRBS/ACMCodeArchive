{"scoring":null,"notes":"In the first example, $1 \\times 2 \\times 4 \\times 11 \\times 13 = 1144$, which is the largest product that ends with the digit 4. The same set of cards without the number 1 is also a valid answer, as well as a set of 8, 11, and 13 with or without 1 that also has the product of 1144.\r\n\r\nIn the second example, all the numbers on the cards are even and their product cannot end with an odd digit 1.\r\n\r\nIn the third example, the only possible products are 1, 3, 5, 9, 15, and 45, none of which end with the digit 7.\r\n\r\nIn the fourth example, $9 \\times 11 \\times 17 = 1683$, which ends with the digit 3. \r\n\r\nIn the fifth example, $2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 16$, which ends with the digit 6.","legend":"Diana loves playing with numbers. She's got $n$ cards with positive integer numbers $a_i$ written on them. She spends her free time multiplying the numbers on the cards. She picks a \r\nnon-empty subset of the cards and multiplies all the numbers $a_i$ written on them.\r\n\r\nDiana is happy when the product of the numbers ends with her favorite digit $d$. Now she is curious what cards she should pick so that the product of the numbers on them is the largest possible and the last decimal digit of the product is $d$.
