This is equiv. to a (1, 1, 1, 1) NIM game (careful: you can have one
camera in position (1, 0) and another in position (2, 0), because
adjacency between cameras is not restricted when they are assigned to
different wet areas). Losing position.
If one is not careful, it would be equiv. to a (2, 1, 1) NIM game
which is winning.
