\noindent

We sweep over the integers in the list in order and will attempt to construct
the desired subsequence directly.

There are two cases to consider when considering the $i$th integer in the input
list.

\begin{enumerate}
\item The given integer is already present in our subsequence. We do nothing.
\item The given integer is not present in our subsequence. This is the
interesting case to consider.

While our tentative subsequence is not empty, we will compare the given integer
to the last integer in our subsequence. If the given integer is larger than
the last integer in our subsequence, then append it to the end
of our subsequence. Otherwise, it is smaller than the last integer. We can
safely remove this integer if and only if there is another appearance of this
integer that will be considered later in the sweep. We repeat this removal
process until we can no longer remove an integer, at which we perform the
append.
\end{enumerate}
