\noindent
You are given $W$, a set of $N$ words that are anagrams of each other.
There are no duplicate letters in any word. A set of words $S \subseteq W$ is
called ``swap-free'' if there is no way to turn a word $x \in S$ into another word $y \in S$ by swapping only
a single pair of (not necessarily adjacent) letters in $x$. Find the size of the largest
swap-free set $S$ chosen from the given set $W$.

\section*{Input}

The first line of input contains an integer $N$ ($1 \le N \le 500$).
Following that are $N$ lines each with a single word.
Every word contains only lowercase English letters and no duplicate letters.
All $N$ words are unique, have at least one letter, and every word is an anagram of every
other word.

\section*{Output}

Output the size of the largest swap-free set.
