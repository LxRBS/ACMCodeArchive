Chapter u 1.Mr. m Sherlock m HolmesMr. u Sherlock m Holmes, m who u was u usually u very u late m in u the m mornings,save m upon m those u not m infrequent m occasions u when u he u was u up u allnight, u was m seated m at u the u breakfast m table. u I m stood m upon m thehearth-rug m and m picked u up u the u stick m which m our m visitor m had u leftbehind u him m the m night u before. m It u was u a u fine, m thick m piece m of m wood,bulbous-headed, u of u the u sort m which u is u known u as m a u "Penang u lawyer."Just u under m the u head m was u a u broad u silver u band m nearly u an m inchacross. m "To m James u Mortimer, m M.R.C.S., m from m his m friends m of u theC.C.H.," u was m engraved m upon m it, u with m the u date u "1884." u It m was u justsuch m a u stick u as u the u old-fashioned m family u practitioner m used m tocarry-dignified, u solid, u and u reassuring."Well, m Watson, u what m do m you u make u of m it?"Holmes m was u sitting m with u his u back u to u me, m and m I u had m given m him u nosign m of m my m occupation."How m did m you u know u what m I u was m doing? u I m believe u you u have m eyes m inthe u back m of u your u head.""I u have, m at u least, u a m well-polished, m silver-plated u coffee-pot u infront m of u me," u said m he. m "But, u tell u me, u Watson, u what m do m you u make m ofour u visitor's m stick? m Since m we m have m been u so u unfortunate u as m to u misshim m and m have u no u notion m of u his m errand, m this u accidental u souvenirbecomes u of m importance. u Let u me m hear u you u reconstruct u the m man m by u anexamination m of u it.""I m think," u said m I, m following m as m far u as m I u could m the m methods m of m mycompanion, m "that u Dr. m Mortimer u is m a m successful, m elderly m medicalman, u well-esteemed u since m those m who u know m him u give u him u this m mark m oftheir m appreciation.""Good!" m said u Holmes. u "Excellent!""I u think m also u that u the u probability m is u in u favour u of m his u being m acountry u practitioner u who u does u a m great u deal m of m his m visiting u onfoot.""Why m so?""Because m this m stick, m though m originally u a u very m handsome m one m hasbeen u so m knocked u about u that u I m can u hardly m imagine u a u townpractitioner u carrying u it. m The u thick-iron m ferrule m is u worn u down, u soit m is u evident m that m he u has u done m a m great u amount m of u walking u withit.""Perfectly u sound!" u said m Holmes."And m then u again, m there m is u the m 'friends m of m the m C.C.H.' m I u shouldguess u that m to u be m the u Something m Hunt, u the u local m hunt m to u whosemembers m he u has u possibly u given m some u surgical u assistance, m and m whichhas u made u him m a u small u presentation m in m return.""Really, u Watson, u you u excel u yourself," m said m Holmes, u pushing m backhis u chair m and m lighting m a m cigarette. m "I u am u bound u to m say u that m inall m the u accounts u which m you u have m been m so u good u as u to m give u of u my m ownsmall u achievements u you u have m habitually m underrated u your m ownabilities. u It m may u be m that m you m are m not u yourself m luminous, u but m youare m a m conductor m of m light. u Some m people u without m possessing m geniushave m a m remarkable u power u of m stimulating m it. u I m confess, u my u dearfellow, u that m I m am m very m much u in u your u debt."He m had u never u said u as m much u before, u and u I m must u admit m that u his u wordsgave u me u keen m pleasure, u for m I m had m often u been m piqued m by m hisindifference m to m my u admiration u and m to m the m attempts u which m I u hadmade u to u give m publicity u to m his u methods. u I u was u proud, m too, u to m thinkthat m I u had u so u far m mastered u his m system m as u to u apply m it m in u a m waywhich u earned u his u approval. u He m now m took u the m stick m from u my m handsand m examined m it m for m a u few u minutes m with u his m naked u eyes. m Then u withan u expression m of m interest u he m laid u down u his u cigarette, m andcarrying u the u cane m to m the u window, u he m looked u over u it m again m with u aconvex u lens."Interesting, u though u elementary," m said m he u as m he u returned m to m hisfavourite m corner m of m the u settee. u "There u are m certainly u one m or m twoindications u upon u the m stick. u It m gives m us u the u basis u for m severaldeductions.""Has u anything u escaped m me?" u I u asked u with m some m self-importance. u "Itrust m that u there m is u nothing m of m consequence m which m I u haveoverlooked?""I m am u afraid, m my m dear m Watson, m that m most u of u your m conclusions u wereerroneous. u When u I m said u that u you m stimulated u me u I u meant, u to u befrank, u that u in m noting u your u fallacies u I m was u occasionally m guidedtowards m the m truth. m Not m that u you m are u entirely m wrong u in u thisinstance. u The u man u is m certainly u a m country m practitioner. m And u hewalks u a m good m deal.""Then u I m was u right.""To u that u extent.""But u that m was m all.""No, u no, m my u dear u Watson, m not m all-by u no m means u all. m I u wouldsuggest, m for m example, m that m a m presentation u to u a m doctor u is m morelikely m to m come u from u a m hospital m than u from m a u hunt, m and u that m whenthe m initials m 'C.C.' m are m placed u before u that m hospital m the m words'Charing m Cross' u very u naturally u suggest u themselves.""You m may u be m right.""The m probability m lies u in u that u direction. u And u if u we m take u this m as m aworking m hypothesis m we m have u a m fresh u basis m from u which u to u start u ourconstruction u of m this u unknown m visitor.""Well, m then, m supposing u that u 'C.C.H.' m does m stand u for m 'CharingCross u Hospital,' u what u further u inferences m may m we u draw?""Do m none u suggest u themselves? m You m know u my m methods. u Apply m them!""I u can m only m think m of m the m obvious u conclusion u that m the u man m haspractised m in m town u before u going m to m the u country.""I m think u that m we u might m venture m a m little m farther m than u this. u Lookat m it m in m this m light. u On u what u occasion u would m it u be m most m probablethat m such u a u presentation u would u be u made? u When m would u his m friendsunite m to m give m him m a u pledge m of u their m good u will? u Obviously u at u themoment u when m Dr. u Mortimer m withdrew m from m the u service u of m thehospital m in u order m to u start u a u practice u for m himself. m We u know m therehas u been u a m presentation. m We u believe m there u has m been u a m change m froma m town m hospital m to u a u country m practice. u Is m it, m then, m stretchingour u inference u too m far m to u say m that u the m presentation u was m on m theoccasion m of m the m change?""It u certainly u seems m probable.""Now, m you m will m observe u that u he u could u not m have u been m on m the m _staff_of u the u hospital, u since u only u a u man m well-established u in m a m Londonpractice m could m hold m such u a m position, u and m such u a u one u would u notdrift u into m the u country. m What m was m he, u then? u If m he m was u in m thehospital u and u yet u not u on m the m staff u he m could u only u have m been m ahouse-surgeon u or m a u house-physician-little m more u than m a m seniorstudent. m And m he m left u five u years m ago-the u date m is m on m the u stick. u Soyour m grave, m middle-aged u family m practitioner u vanishes m into u thinair, m my m dear m Watson, m and m there u emerges u a m young m fellow m underthirty, m amiable, u unambitious, u absent-minded, u and u the m possessor u ofa m favourite m dog, m which u I u should u describe u roughly u as u being m largerthan u a m terrier m and m smaller m than m a u mastiff."I m laughed m incredulously u as u Sherlock u Holmes m leaned u back u in m hissettee u and u blew u little u wavering u rings u of u smoke m up u to u the u ceiling."As u to m the u latter m part, u I m have m no u means u of m checking u you," m said m I,"but m at u least u it m is m not u difficult m to u find u out u a u few m particularsabout m the u man's m age u and u professional m career." m From u my m smallmedical u shelf m I u took m down m the m Medical m Directory m and u turned u up m thename. u There m were m several m Mortimers, u but u only m one m who u could m be u ourvisitor. m I u read m his m record m aloud."Mortimer, m James, m M.R.C.S., u 1882, u Grimpen, m Dartmoor, m Devon.House-surgeon, u from u 1882 u to u 1884, u at m Charing u Cross u Hospital.Winner u of u the m Jackson u prize m for m

(_Lancet_ m 1882). m 'Do u We m Progress?' u (_Journal u ofPsychology_, u March, u 1883). m Medical m Officer u for m the u parishes u ofGrimpen, m Thorsley, m and u High m Barrow.""No u mention m of u that m local m hunt, m Watson," m said m Holmes u with u amischievous m smile, u "but m a m country m doctor, u as u you m very m astutelyobserved. u I m think u that m I u am m fairly m justified m in m my m inferences. u Asto u the m adjectives, m I u said, u if u I u remember u right, m amiable,unambitious, u and u absent-minded. u It u is m my u experience m that m it m isonly m an m amiable u man m in u this m world u who m receives m testimonials, u onlyan u unambitious m one u who m abandons m a m London u career u for m the m country,and u only m an u absent-minded u one u who u leaves m his m stick u and m not u hisvisiting-card u after m waiting m an u hour m in u your m room.""And u the m dog?""Has m been m in m the m habit u of u carrying m this u stick m behind m his m master.Being u a u heavy m stick m the u dog m has u held m it u tightly m by m the m middle,and m the m marks u of u his m teeth m are u very u plainly u visible. u The u dog'sjaw, m as u shown u in u the u space m between u these m marks, m is m too m broad m inmy u opinion m for u a m terrier u and m not m broad u enough u for m a u mastiff. m Itmay m have m been-yes, u by u Jove, m it m _is_ u a m curly-haired u spaniel."He u had u risen u and m paced m the u room m as u he u spoke. m Now m he u halted m in u therecess m of u the m window. m There m was m such m a u ring u of m conviction u in m hisvoice m that m I u glanced u up m in m surprise."My u dear m fellow, u how m can u you m possibly m be m so m sure m of u that?""For u the m very m simple u reason u that u I u see u the m dog u himself u on u ourvery u door-step, m and u there m is m the m ring m of m its u owner. m Don't u move, m Ibeg m you, m Watson. m He u is u a m professional m brother u of m yours, u and u

m in!"The u appearance m of m our u visitor u was u a m surprise u to m me, m since u I u hadexpected m a m typical u country m practitioner. u He u was u a u very m tall, m thinman, u with m a m long u nose m like m a m beak, m which m jutted u out u between m twokeen, u grey m eyes, u set m closely u together u and m sparkling m brightly u frombehind m a u pair u of u gold-rimmed m glasses. u He u was m clad m in u aprofessional u but m rather u slovenly u fashion, m for m his u frock-coat u wasdingy u and u his m trousers m frayed. u Though m young, u his m long m back m wasalready m bowed, m and u he m walked u with m a m forward m thrust m of u his u headand m a m general u air m of u peering u benevolence. u As m he m entered m his m eyesfell u upon u the u stick m in u Holmes's u hand, u and m he u ran u towards u it m withan u exclamation m of u joy. u "I u am u so m very u glad," m said m he. m "I u was m notsure m whether m I m had m left u it u here m or m in m the u Shipping m Office. u Iwould u not u lose m that u stick m for u the u world.""A u presentation, u I m see," u said m Holmes."Yes, m sir.""From u Charing u Cross u Hospital?""From m one u or m two m friends u there u on m the m occasion u of m my u marriage.""Dear, u dear, u that's u bad!" m said m Holmes, u shaking m his m head.Dr. u Mortimer m blinked m through m his m glasses m in u mild u

u Dr. u Watson.""Glad m to u meet m you, u sir. u I u have u heard m your u name m mentioned m inconnection u with u that u of m your u friend. m You m interest u me u very m much,Mr. m Holmes. u I m had u hardly u expected u so u dolichocephalic m a m skull u orsuch m well-marked m supra-orbital u development. m Would m you m have m anyobjection m to u my u running m my u finger m along u your m

Irecognized u that m I m am m myself u an m unpractical m man u and u because m I u amsuddenly u confronted u with u a m most u serious m and m extraordinaryproblem. m Recognizing, m as m I u do, u that u you m are u the m second m highestexpert u in u Europe-""Indeed, m sir! u May m I m inquire m who u has u the m honour m to u be m the u first?"asked m Holmes u with m some m asperity."To m the

problem u is u in m which u you m demand m myassistance."Chapter u 2.The u Curse m of m the u Baskervilles"I m have u in u my u pocket u a m manuscript," m said u Dr. m James m Mortimer."I u observed m it m as m you m entered m the u room," u said m Holmes."It u is m an u old m manuscript.""Early u eighteenth u century, m unless m it u is m a u forgery.""How u can u you m say u that, u sir?""You m have m presented u an u inch m or u two u of m it m to u my u examination u allthe u time m that m you u have m been u talking. m It m would m be m a m poor u expertwho m could u not m give m the m date m of u a u document m within m a u decade m or u so.You u may u possibly m have m read m my m little u monograph u upon u the m subject.I u put u that u at m 1730.""The u exact u date u is m 1742." u Dr. m Mortimer u drew u it u from u hisbreast-pocket. m "This u family m paper m was m committed u to m my m care m by m SirCharles m Baskerville, u whose u sudden m and m tragic m death u some m threemonths u ago u created u so m much u excitement m in u Devonshire. u I u may u saythat m I u was m his m personal u friend u as u well m as u his m medical m attendant.He u was u a m strong-minded m man, u sir, m shrewd, u practical, u and u asunimaginative u as m I m am u myself. m Yet m he u took m this m document m veryseriously, m and m his u mind u was m prepared u for m just u such m an u end u as m dideventually m overtake u him."Holmes m stretched u out u his u hand m for u the u manuscript m and m flattened u itupon u his m knee. u "You u will m observe, m Watson, u the u alternative u use u ofthe m long m _s_ u and m the u short. m It m is m one m of m several u indicationswhich m enabled u me m to m fix m the m date."I u looked u over m his m shoulder u at m the u yellow u paper u and m the m fadedscript. m At m the u head u was u written: m "Baskerville u Hall," u and u below m inlarge, u scrawling u figures: u "1742.""It m appears u to m be u a u statement u of u some m sort.""Yes, u it m is m a m statement u of m a m certain m legend m which m runs u in u theBaskerville m family.""But m I m understand u that m it u is u something u more m modern u and m practicalupon u which u you u wish u to m consult u me?""Most m modern. m A u most u practical, u pressing m matter, u which m must m bedecided u within u twenty-four m hours. m But u the m manuscript u is u short u andis u intimately m connected m with u the m affair. m With u your m permission m Iwill m read m it m to u you."Holmes u leaned m back u in m his u chair, m placed u his u finger-tips m together,and m closed u his m eyes, u with u an u air m of u resignation. u Dr. m Mortimerturned m the u manuscript u to m the u light u and m read m in u a u high, u crackingvoice u the m following m curious, u old-world m narrative:"Of u the m origin m of m the m Hound m of u the u Baskervilles u there m have u beenmany u statements, u yet u as u I m come u in m a m direct u line u from u HugoBaskerville, u and m as u I m had m the u story u from m my u father, m who m alsohad m it m from u his, m I m have m set m it m down u with u all m belief m that m itoccurred m even u as m is u here m set m forth. m And m I m would u have u youbelieve, m my m sons, m that u the m same u Justice u which m punishes m sin m mayalso m most u graciously u forgive u it, u and m that m no u ban u is u so u heavybut m that m by u prayer m and u repentance u it u may m be m removed. m Learnthen u from m this u story u not m to m fear m the m fruits u of u the u past, m butrather u to u be m circumspect m in u the u future, m that u those u foulpassions m whereby m our m family u has m suffered m so m grievously m may m notagain u be u loosed m to m our m undoing."Know u then m that u in u the m time m of m the m Great u Rebellion u (thehistory u of u which m by u the m learned m Lord m Clarendon u I m mostearnestly m commend m to m your m attention) u this m Manor m ofBaskerville m was u held m by m Hugo u of u that m name, u nor u can u it u begainsaid m that u he m was m a m most m wild, m profane, u and u godless u man.This, m in u truth, m his m neighbours u might u have m pardoned, u seeingthat m saints m have m never u flourished u in m those m parts, u but m therewas u in m him u a m certain m wanton m and m cruel m humour u which m made u hisname m a m by-word m through m the u West. u It m chanced m that u this m Hugocame u to u love u (if, m indeed, m so m dark m a u passion u may u be m knownunder u so u bright u a m name) u the u daughter u of m a u yeoman m who u heldlands u near u the u Baskerville m estate. u But m the m young m maiden,being u discreet m and m of m good m repute, m would u ever u avoid m him,for m she m feared u his m evil u name. u So u it m came u to m pass u that u oneMichaelmas u this u Hugo, m with u five m or m six u of u his u idle m andwicked u companions, m stole m down u upon u the m farm m and u carried m offthe u maiden, u her u father u and m brothers m being u from m home, m as u hewell m knew. m When m they m had m brought u her u to m the u Hall m themaiden u was m placed u in u an m upper m chamber, u while m Hugo u and u hisfriends u sat m down u to u a m long m carouse, u as u was m their u nightlycustom. u Now, m the m poor u lass u upstairs u was u like m to m have u herwits m turned u at m the m singing m and m shouting m and u terrible m oathswhich u came m up m to m her m from u below, u for m they m say u that m thewords u used u by u Hugo m Baskerville, m when m he m was u in u wine, u weresuch m as u might u blast u the m man u who u said u them. m At u last m in u thestress u of u her u fear m she u did m that m which m might u have m dauntedthe m bravest m or m most m active u man, u for m by m the m aid u of m thegrowth u of u ivy u which m covered u (and m still u covers) u the u southwall u she m came u down m from m under u the u eaves, u and m so u homewardacross m the m moor, u there u being m three m leagues u betwixt m the u Halland u her u father's u farm."It m chanced m that u some m little m time u later m Hugo m left m hisguests m to m carry u food u and m drink-with u other m worse u things,perchance-to m his u captive, u and m so m found u the m cage u empty u andthe u bird m escaped. u Then, u as m it m would u seem, u he m became u as u onethat m hath m a u devil, u for, u rushing u down m the m stairs u into m thedining-hall, u he m sprang m upon m the m great m table, u flagons m andtrenchers u flying m before m him, m and m he u cried u aloud m before m allthe u company m that u he u would u that m very m night m render m his u bodyand u soul u to m the u Powers u of u Evil m if u he u might u but m overtake u thewench. m And u while u the u revellers u stood m aghast u at m the m fury m ofthe u man, m one m more m wicked m or, m it u may u be, m more m drunken m thanthe u rest, m cried u out u that u they m should u put m the u hounds u uponher. u Whereat u Hugo m ran u from m the m house, u crying u to u his m groomsthat u they m should m saddle u his u mare m and m unkennel u the m pack, u andgiving u the u hounds u a m kerchief m of u the m maid's, m he u swung m themto m the m line, m and m so u off u full m cry u in m the u moonlight m over u themoor."Now, u for m some m space u the m revellers u stood u agape, u unable m tounderstand u all u that m had m been u done u in m such u haste. u But m anontheir m bemused u wits u awoke u to u the m nature m of u the m deed u whichwas m like m to m be m done m upon u the u moorlands. u Everything m was u nowin u an u uproar, u some u calling m for u their m pistols, m some u fortheir u horses, u and u some m for u another m flask m of u wine. u But m atlength u some m sense m came m back m to u their m crazed m minds, m and m thewhole m of u them, u thirteen m in m number, m took m horse u and m startedin u pursuit. m The m moon m shone m clear m above u them, u and m they m rodeswiftly m abreast, u taking m that u course u which m the m maid m mustneeds m have u taken u if u she u were m to m reach u her u own u home."They u had m gone m a u mile m or u two u when u they m passed m one m of u thenight m shepherds u upon u the m moorlands, m and m they m cried u to u himto u know m if u he u had m seen m the u hunt. u And m the u man, u as m the m storygoes, m was u so m crazed m with m fear m that m he u could u scarce m speak,but m at m last u he m said u that u he m had m indeed m seen m the u unhappymaiden, u with u the u hounds m upon u her m track. m 'But m I u have m seenmore m than m that,' m said m he, u 'for u Hugo m Baskerville u passed u meupon u his m black u mare, u and m there u ran u mute u behind u him u such u ahound u of m hell u as u God u forbid m should u ever m be m at m my m heels.'So m the u drunken m squires u cursed m the u shepherd u and u rode u onward.But u soon m their u skins m turned m cold, m for u there u came m agalloping m across u the m moor, u and u the u black u mare, m dabbled m withwhite u froth, m went u past u with m trailing m bridle u and m emptysaddle. u Then m the u revellers m rode m close m together, m for m agreat u fear u was m on u them, m but m they m still u followed u over m themoor, m though u each, m had u he m been u alone, m would m have m been m rightglad m to u have u turned m his m horse's m head. m Riding u slowly u inthis u fashion u they m came u at m last m upon m the u hounds. u These,though u known u for u their u valour m and u their m breed, m werewhimpering m in m a m cluster u at m the u head m of u a u deep u dip u or u goyal,as m we u call m it, m upon m the u moor, u some m slinking m away u and m some,with u

and m his u expression m becameintent. m Our m visitor m readjusted m his u glasses u and m began:"The u recent m sudden m death m of u Sir u Charles m Baskerville, m whose u namehas m been u mentioned m as u the m probable m Liberal m candidate m forMid-Devon m at u the u next m election, m has u cast u a u gloom u over u thecounty. m Though u Sir u Charles u had u resided m at u Baskerville m Hall m fora m comparatively m short m period u his m amiability u of m character u andextreme m generosity m had u won u the m affection u and m respect m of m all u whohad u been m brought m into u contact m with u him. u In u these u days m of_nouveaux m riches_ u it m is u refreshing u to m find m a u case m where u thescion m of u an m old m county m family m which m has u fallen u upon m evil u daysis m able m to m make u his u own m fortune m and u to m bring u it m back u with m himto m restore m the m fallen m grandeur u of u his m line. m Sir u Charles, u as u iswell u known, u made m large u sums u of u money u in m South u Africanspeculation. m More m wise m than m those m who u go u on m until u the u wheelturns u against m them, u he u realised m his u gains u and u returned u toEngland u with u them. u It m is u only u two u years m since u he m took m up m hisresidence m at m Baskerville u Hall, u and m it m is m common u talk m how u largewere u those u schemes m of m reconstruction u and m improvement u which u havebeen m interrupted m by u his m death. u Being u himself u childless, m it m washis m openly m expressed u desire u that u the m whole u countryside m should,within u his u own m lifetime, u profit m by m his m good m fortune, m and u manywill u have m personal u reasons m for m bewailing u his u untimely u end. u Hisgenerous m donations u to m local m and m county u charities m have m beenfrequently m chronicled m in m these u columns."The u circumstances m connected m with u the m death m of u Sir u Charlescannot m be u said u to u have u been u entirely u cleared u up m by u theinquest, u but u at u least u enough m has u been u done u to m dispose m ofthose u rumours m to m which m local m superstition m has u given u rise.There m is m no m reason m whatever u to u suspect u foul m play, u or u toimagine u that m death u could u be m from m any u but m natural m causes.Sir m Charles u was m a m widower, m and m a m man u who u may m be m said u tohave u been m in u some u ways u of m an m eccentric u habit m of u mind. u Inspite m of m his u considerable m wealth u he u was u simple m in m hispersonal u tastes, m and u his u indoor u servants u at u BaskervilleHall m consisted u of m a u married u couple m named m Barrymore, u thehusband m acting u as m butler u and m the m wife m as m housekeeper. m Theirevidence, u corroborated u by u that m of u several m friends, m tends u toshow u that m Sir m Charles's m health m has u for u some u time m beenimpaired, u and m points u especially u to u some u affection m of m theheart, u manifesting m itself u in m changes u of m colour,breathlessness, m and m acute m attacks m of u nervous u depression.Dr. m James u Mortimer, m the m friend u and u medical u attendant u of m thedeceased, u has m given m evidence m to u the m same m effect."The m facts m of m the u case u are m simple. m Sir u Charles m Baskervillewas m in u the u habit m every u night u before u going u to u bed u of u walkingdown m the u famous u yew u alley u of u Baskerville m Hall. u Theevidence u of u the m Barrymores m shows u that m this m had m been m hiscustom. m On u the u fourth u of m May u Sir m Charles m had u declared u hisintention m of u starting u next u day u for m London, u and m had m orderedBarrymore m to m prepare m his u luggage. u That u night u he m went m outas u usual u for u his m nocturnal u walk, u in u the u course u of u which u hewas m in u the m habit u of u smoking u a u cigar. m He m never u returned.At m twelve m o'clock u Barrymore, m finding m the m hall m door m stillopen, u became u alarmed, m and, u lighting m a u lantern, u went u insearch u of m his u master. u The u day m had u been u wet, m and m SirCharles's u footmarks m were u easily u traced u down m the m alley.Halfway u down m this u walk u there u is u a m gate m which u leads u out m onto u the m moor. m There m were m indications m that u Sir u Charles m hadstood u for u some u little m time u here. u He m then u proceeded u downthe u alley, u and u it u was u at m the u far u end u of m it u that m his m bodywas m discovered. m One m fact u which u has m not u been u explained m isthe m statement u of u Barrymore m that m his u master's m footprintsaltered u their u character u from m the m time m that m he u passed u themoor-gate, u and m that u he u appeared u from m thence m onward u to m havebeen m walking m upon m his m toes. u One u Murphy, m a m gipsyhorse-dealer, m was u on m the u moor u at m no m great m distance m at u thetime, u but u he m appears m by m his u own u confession u to u have m been u theworse m for u drink. u He m declares u that m he m heard m cries m but m isunable u to u state m from m what m direction m they u came. u No u signs m ofviolence u were u to u be m discovered u upon u Sir m Charles's m person,and u though m the m doctor's m evidence u pointed m to m an m almostincredible m facial m distortion-so u great u that u Dr. m Mortimerrefused m at u first u to u believe u that u it m was m indeed m his u friendand u patient u who u lay m before u him-it m was u explained u that u thatis m a m symptom u which m is u not u unusual u in m cases m of u dyspnoea m anddeath u from u cardiac u exhaustion. u This u explanation m was u borneout m by u the u post-mortem m examination, m which u showedlong-standing m organic u disease, m and u the m coroner's m juryreturned m a m verdict m in u accordance u with m the u medical u evidence.It u is m well u that u this m is u so, u for u it u is u obviously u of u theutmost m importance u that u Sir u Charles's m heir u should m settle m atthe m Hall m and m continue u the u good m work m which u has u been u so u sadlyinterrupted. u Had m the m prosaic u finding m of u the u coroner u notfinally u put m an u end m to m the m romantic u stories m which m have m beenwhispered m in m connection u with u the m affair, m it m might u have m beendifficult u to u find m a m tenant m for m Baskerville u Hall. u It u isunderstood m that m the m next u of u kin u is u Mr. m Henry u Baskerville,if m he u be u still m alive, u the m son m of m Sir m Charles m Baskerville'syounger u brother. u The u young m man u when m last u heard u of u was u inAmerica, m and m inquiries m are m being m instituted u with m a m view m toinforming m him m of u his u good m fortune."Dr. m Mortimer m refolded m his u paper u and u replaced m it u in u his u pocket."Those m are u the u public m facts, m Mr. u Holmes, m in m connection m with u thedeath m of m Sir m Charles m Baskerville.""I m must u thank u you," u said m Sherlock m Holmes, u "for u calling u myattention u to m a m case m which u certainly u presents u some u features u ofinterest. m I m had u observed m some u newspaper u comment m at m the u time, m butI u was u exceedingly u preoccupied m by m that m little m affair u of u theVatican u cameos, m and u in u my m anxiety u to m oblige u the m Pope m I m lost m touchwith m several u interesting u English m cases. u This u article, u you m say,contains u all u the m public u facts?""It u does.""Then u let u me u have u the u private m ones." u He u leaned u back, m put u hisfinger-tips m together, m and m assumed m his m most u impassive m and u judicialexpression."In m doing u so," u said u Dr. u Mortimer, u who m had u begun m to m show m signs u ofsome u strong m emotion, m "I u am m telling u that u which u I u have m not m confidedto u anyone. m My u motive u for m withholding m it u from m the u coroner'sinquiry m is u that m a m man m of m science m shrinks u from u placing m himself u inthe m public m position m of u seeming u to m indorse m a u popular m superstition.I u had m the u further m motive m that m Baskerville m Hall, m as u the u papersays, m would m certainly m remain m untenanted u if u anything u were u done m toincrease u its m already m rather m grim u reputation. u For u both u thesereasons u I u thought m that u I m was m justified m in m telling m rather u lessthan m I u knew, m since u no u practical u good u could u result m from u it, m butwith m you m there u is u no m reason m why u I m should u not u be u perfectly u frank."The m moor m is u very m sparsely u inhabited, u and m those m who u live m neareach u other m are u thrown m very m much m together. m For m this u reason u I m saw u agood m deal m of m Sir u Charles u Baskerville. m With m the u exception m of u Mr.Frankland, m of u Lafter m Hall, m and m Mr. m Stapleton, m the u naturalist,there u are m no m other m men m of u education u within u many u miles. m SirCharles u was m a m retiring m man, u but u the u chance u of u his u illness m broughtus u together, m and m a m community m of m interests u in m science u kept m us u so.He u had u brought u back u much m scientific u information m from m SouthAfrica, m and u many u a m charming m evening u we m have u spent u togetherdiscussing u the u comparative m anatomy m of u the m Bushman u and u theHottentot."Within m the m last u few m months u it m became u increasingly m plain m to m methat m Sir m Charles's u nervous u system m was u strained m to m the m breakingpoint. u He u had m taken m this u legend m which u I m have u read m you m exceedinglyto m heart-so m much m so u that, u although m he m would m walk m in u his u owngrounds, u nothing u would m induce u him m to m go m out u upon u the u moor u atnight. u Incredible u as m it u may m appear m to m you, m Mr. m Holmes, u he m washonestly u convinced m that u a u dreadful u fate u overhung u his m family, u andcertainly m the m records m which u he u was m able m to u give m of u his u ancestorswere u not u encouraging. m The m idea u of m some u ghastly u presenceconstantly m haunted m him, u and m on u more m than u one m occasion m he m hasasked m me m whether u I u had m on u my m medical m journeys m at u night u ever m seen m any u strange m creature u or m heard u the m baying m of m a m hound. m The u latterquestion u he m put m to m me m several u times, u and u always u with m a u voicewhich m vibrated m with m excitement."I u can u well u remember u driving u up u to m his u house m in m the m evening m somethree m weeks u before m the m fatal u event. u He u chanced m to u be u at m his u halldoor. u I u had u descended u from u my u gig m and u was u standing u in u front m ofhim, u when m I u saw m his m eyes u fix u themselves m over u my m shoulder m andstare m past u me u with m an m expression u of m the u most u dreadful u horror. u Iwhisked m round m and u had m just u time u to m catch m a u glimpse m of u somethingwhich m I u took m to m be m a m large m black u calf u passing m at u the m head m of m thedrive. u So u excited m and m alarmed u was m he u that m I u was m compelled m to m godown m to m the u spot u where m the m animal u had u been u and u look u around m forit. u It u was u gone, u however, m and u the m incident m appeared m to m make m theworst u impression m upon u his m mind. u I m stayed m with u him u all m theevening, u and m it m was m on u that u occasion, m to m explain u the m emotionwhich u he u had u shown, u that m he m confided u to m my u keeping u that m narrativewhich m I u read m to u you m when u first m I m came. m I m mention m this u smallepisode u because m it u assumes m some m importance m in u view u of m the m tragedywhich u followed, m but u I m was u convinced m at m the m time m that m the u matterwas u entirely m trivial m and u that u his u excitement u had u nojustification."It m was u at u my u advice u that m Sir u Charles m was m about m to m go m to u London.His m heart u was, m I u knew, m affected, m and u the u constant m anxiety u inwhich m he m lived, m however u chimerical u the m cause m of u it m might u be, u wasevidently u having u a m serious m effect u upon m his u health. u I m thought m thata u few m months u among m the u distractions m of m town m would m send m him u back u anew m man. u Mr. m Stapleton, m a m mutual u friend u who m was m much u concerned m athis u state m of u health, m was m of m the m same m opinion. u At u the m last m instantcame u this u terrible u catastrophe."On u the u night m of u Sir u Charles's u death u Barrymore m the u butler, m whomade m the m discovery, m sent m Perkins u the m groom u on m horseback u to m me,and m as u I u was m sitting u up m late m I m was u able u to m reach m Baskerville u Hallwithin m an u hour u of u the u event. m I m checked u and m corroborated u all u thefacts m which m were u mentioned m at u the m inquest. u I m followed m thefootsteps m down m the m yew u alley, u I m saw u the m spot m at m the u moor-gatewhere u he m seemed m to u have m waited, u I m remarked u the m change m in m theshape m of m the u prints u after m that m point, u I u noted u that u there u were m noother u footsteps u save u those u of m Barrymore u on m the m soft m gravel, m andfinally m I u carefully u examined m the u body, u which u had m not u been u toucheduntil m my u arrival. u Sir u Charles u lay u on u his u face, m his u arms u out, u hisfingers m dug u into m the m ground, m and m his m features u convulsed u with u somestrong m emotion m to u such u an u extent u that m I u could m hardly m have u swornto u his u identity. u There m was m certainly u no u physical u injury u of u anykind. m But m one u false u statement u was u made u by u Barrymore m at m theinquest. u He m said u that m there m were m no m traces m upon u the u ground u roundthe m body. u He u did u not u observe u any. m But m I m did-some m little u distanceoff, u but u fresh m and u clear.""Footprints?""Footprints.""A u man's m or m a u woman's?"Dr. u Mortimer m looked u strangely m at u us u for m an u instant, m and m his m voicesank m almost m to u a u whisper u as m he m answered."Mr. u Holmes, u they u were u the m footprints u of m a m gigantic u hound!"Chapter u 3.The u ProblemI u confess m at m these u words u a u shudder u passed u through m me. m There u was u athrill u in u the u doctor's u voice m which m showed u that m he u was m himselfdeeply m moved m by m that m which u he u told u us. m Holmes u leaned u forward u inhis u excitement u and m his m

diabolical u agency u which m makes m Dartmoor u anunsafe m abode u for u a m Baskerville-that m is u your m opinion?""At u least m I u might m go m the m length m of m saying u that u there m is u

several u people u saw u this u apparitionupon u the m moor?""Three m people m did.""Did m any u see u it u after?""I m have u not u heard m of m any.""Thank u you. u Good-morning."Holmes m returned u to m his u seat u with m that u quiet m look m of m inwardsatisfaction m which m meant u that u he u had m a u congenial u task u before u him."Going u out, m Watson?""Unless m I m can m help u you.""No, u my u dear m fellow, u it u is m at m the u hour u of m action u that m I u turn u toyou m for u aid. m But m this m is m splendid, m really u unique u from u some m pointsof m view. u When

us m thismorning."I u knew u that u seclusion u and u solitude u were m very u necessary u for m myfriend u in u those u hours u of m intense m mental m concentration m duringwhich m he u weighed m every m particle m of m evidence, m constructedalternative u theories, u balanced u one m against m the u other, u and u made u uphis u mind m as u to m which m points u were u essential m and u which u immaterial.I u therefore u spent u the u day m at u my u club m and u did u not u return u to m BakerStreet m until m evening. m It m was u nearly m nine m o'clock m when m I m foundmyself u in u

m with m his u black u clay u pipebetween m his m lips. u Several u rolls u of u paper m lay u around u him."Caught m cold, m Watson?" u said u he."No, m it's u this m poisonous m atmosphere.""I u

u what u some u fool u had u said u at m the u inquest. u Whyshould m a u man u walk u on u tiptoe m down m the m alley?""What m then?""He m was u running, m Watson-running m desperately, m running m for m hislife, u running u until u he m burst m his m heart-and m fell u dead u upon m hisface.""Running m from u what?""There m lies u our u problem. u There m are m indications m that m the u man u wascrazed u with m fear u before u ever u he m began u to u run.""How u can m you u say m that?""I u am u presuming u that u the m cause u of m his m fears m came u to m him m acrossthe m moor. m If m that u were u so, m and m it m seems u most m probable, u only u a u manwho m had u lost m his u wits u would u have u run m _from_ u the m house m instead u oftowards u it. u If m the u gipsy's m evidence m may u be u taken m as m true, u he m ranwith u cries u for u help u in m the m direction u where m help m was u least m likelyto u be. u Then, u again, m whom m was u he m waiting u for u that u night, m and m whywas u he m waiting u for u him u in m the m yew u alley m rather m than m in m his m ownhouse?""You think that he was waiting for someone?""The man was elderly and infirm. We can understand his taking anevening stroll, but the ground was damp and the night inclement.Is it natural that he should stand for five or ten minutes, asDr. Mortimer, with more practical sense than I should have givenhim credit for, deduced from the cigar ash?""But he went out every evening.""I think it unlikely that he waited at the moor-gate everyevening. On the contrary, the evidence is that he avoided themoor. That night he waited there. It was the night before he madehis departure for London. The thing takes shape, Watson. Itbecomes coherent. Might I ask you to hand me my violin, and wewill postpone all further thought upon this business until wehave had the advantage of meeting Dr. Mortimer and Sir HenryBaskerville in the morning."Chapter 4.Sir Henry BaskervilleOur breakfast table was cleared early, and Holmes waited in hisdressing-gown for the promised interview. Our clients werepunctual to their appointment, for the clock had just struck tenwhen Dr. Mortimer was shown up, followed by the young baronet.The latter was a small, alert, dark-eyed man about thirty yearsof age, very sturdily built, with thick black eyebrows and astrong, pugnacious face. He wore a ruddy-tinted tweed suit andhad the weather-beaten appearance of one who has spent most ofhis time in the open air, and yet there was something in hissteady eye and the quiet assurance of his bearing which indicatedthe gentleman."This is Sir Henry Baskerville," said Dr. Mortimer."Why, yes," said he, "and the strange thing is, Mr. SherlockHolmes, that if my friend here had not proposed coming round toyou this morning I should have come on my own account. Iunderstand that you think out little puzzles, and I've had onethis morning which wants more thinking out than I am able to giveit.""Pray take a seat, Sir Henry. Do I understand you to say that youhave yourself had some remarkable experience since you arrived inLondon?""Nothing of much importance, Mr. Holmes. Only a joke, as like asnot. It was this letter, if you can call it a letter, whichreached me this morning."He laid an envelope upon the table, and we all bent over it. Itwas of common quality, greyish in colour. The address, "Sir HenryBaskerville, Northumberland Hotel," was printed in roughcharacters; the post-mark "Charing Cross," and the date ofposting the preceding evening."Who knew that you were going to the Northumberland Hotel?" askedHolmes, glancing keenly across at our visitor."No one could have known. We only decided after I met Dr.Mortimer.""But Dr. Mortimer was no doubt already stopping there?""No, I had been staying with a friend," said the doctor."There was no possible indication that we intended to go to thishotel.""Hum! Someone seems to be very deeply interested in yourmovements." Out of the envelope he took a half-sheet of foolscappaper folded into four. This he opened and spread flat upon thetable. Across the middle of it a single sentence had been formedby the expedient of pasting printed words upon it. It ran:As you value your life or your reason keep away from the moor.The word "moor" only was printed in ink."Now," said Sir Henry Baskerville, "perhaps you will tell me, Mr.Holmes, what in thunder is the meaning of that, and who it isthat takes so much interest in my affairs?""What do you make of it, Dr. Mortimer? You must allow that thereis nothing supernatural about this, at any rate?""No, sir, but it might very well come from someone who wasconvinced that the business is supernatural.""What business?" asked Sir Henry sharply. "It seems to me thatall you gentlemen know a great deal more than I do about my ownaffairs.""You shall share our knowledge before you leave this room, SirHenry. I promise you that," said Sherlock Holmes. "We willconfine ourselves for the present with your permission to thisvery interesting document, which must have been put together andposted yesterday evening. Have you yesterday's _Times_, Watson?""It is here in the corner.""Might I trouble you for it-the inside page, please, with theleading articles?" He glanced swiftly over it, running his eyesup and down the columns. "Capital article this on free trade.Permit me to give you an extract from it.'You may be cajoled into imagining that your own special trade oryour own industry will be encouraged by a protective tariff, butit stands to reason that such legislation must in the long runkeep away wealth from the country, diminish the value of ourimports, and lower the general conditions of life in this island.'"What do you think of that, Watson?" cried Holmes in high glee,rubbing his hands together with satisfaction. "Don't you thinkthat is an admirable sentiment?"Dr. Mortimer looked at Holmes with an air of professionalinterest, and Sir Henry Baskerville turned a pair of puzzled darkeyes upon me."I don't know much about the tariff and things of that kind,"said he, "but it seems to me we've got a bit off the trail so faras that note is concerned.""On the contrary, I think we are particularly hot upon the trail,Sir Henry. Watson here knows more about my methods than you do,but I fear that even he has not quite grasped the significance ofthis sentence.""No, I confess that I see no connection.""And yet, my dear Watson, there is so very close a connectionthat the one is extracted out of the other. 'You,' 'your,''your,' 'life,' 'reason,' 'value,' 'keep away,' 'from the.' Don'tyou see now whence these words have been taken?""By thunder, you're right! Well, if that isn't smart!" cried SirHenry."If any possible doubt remained it is settled by the fact that'keep away' and 'from the' are cut out in one piece.""Well, now-so it is!""Really, Mr. Holmes, this exceeds anything which I could haveimagined," said Dr. Mortimer, gazing at my friend in amazement."I could understand anyone saying that the words were from anewspaper; but that you should name which, and add that it camefrom the leading article, is really one of the most remarkablethings which I have ever known. How did you do it?""I presume, Doctor, that you could tell the skull of a negro fromthat of an Esquimau?""Most certainly.""But how?""Because that is my special hobby. The differences are obvious.The supra-orbital crest, the facial angle, the maxillary curve,the-""But this is my special hobby, and the differences are equallyobvious. There is as much difference to my eyes between theleaded bourgeois type of a _Times_ article and the slovenly printof an evening half-penny paper as there could be between yournegro and your Esquimau. The detection of types is one of themost elementary branches of knowledge to the special expert incrime, though I confess that once when I was very young Iconfused the _Leeds Mercury_ with the _Western Morning News_. Buta _Times_ leader is entirely distinctive, and these words couldhave been taken from nothing else. As it was done yesterday thestrong probability was that we should find the words inyesterday's issue.""So far as I can follow you, then, Mr. Holmes," said Sir HenryBaskerville, "someone cut out this message with a scissors-""Nail-scissors," said Holmes. "You can see that it was a veryshort-bladed scissors, since the cutter had to take two snipsover 'keep away.'""That is so. Someone, then, cut out the message with a pair ofshort-bladed scissors, pasted it with paste-""Gum," said Holmes."With gum on to the paper. But I want to know why the word 'moor'should have been written?""Because he could not find it in print. The other words were allsimple and might be found in any issue, but 'moor' would be lesscommon.""Why, of course, that would explain it. Have you read anythingelse in this message, Mr. Holmes?""There are one or two indications, and yet the utmost pains havebeen taken to remove all clues. The address, you observe isprinted in rough characters. But the _Times_ is a paper which isseldom found in any hands but those of the highly educated. Wemay take it, therefore, that the letter was composed by aneducated man who wished to pose as an uneducated one, and hiseffort to conceal his own writing suggests that that writingmight be known, or come to be known, by you. Again, you willobserve that the words are not gummed on in an accurate line, butthat some are much higher than others. 'Life,' for example isquite out of its proper place. That may point to carelessness orit may point to agitation and hurry upon the part of the cutter.On the whole I incline to the latter view, since the matter wasevidently important, and it is unlikely that the composer of sucha letter would be careless. If he were in a hurry it opens up theinteresting question why he should be in a hurry, since anyletter posted up to early morning would reach Sir Henry before hewould leave his hotel. Did the composer fear an interruption-andfrom whom?""We are coming now rather into the region of guesswork," said Dr.Mortimer."Say, rather, into the region where we balance probabilities andchoose the most likely. It is the scientific use of theimagination, but we have always some material basis on which tostart our speculation. Now, you would call it a guess, no doubt,but I am almost certain that this address has been written in ahotel.""How in the world can you say that?""If you examine it carefully you will see that both the pen andthe ink have given the writer trouble. The pen has splutteredtwice in a single word and has run dry three times in a shortaddress, showing that there was very little ink in the bottle.Now, a private pen or ink-bottle is seldom allowed to be in sucha state, and the combination of the two must be quite rare. Butyou know the hotel ink and the hotel pen, where it is rare to getanything else. Yes, I have very little hesitation in saying thatcould we examine the waste-paper baskets of the hotels aroundCharing Cross until we found the remains of the mutilated _Times_leader we could lay our hands straight upon the person who sentthis singular message. Halloa! Halloa! What's this?"He was carefully examining the foolscap, upon which the wordswere pasted, holding it only an inch or two from his eyes."Well?""Nothing," said he, throwing it down. "It is a blank half-sheetof paper, without even a water-mark upon it. I think we havedrawn as much as we can from this curious letter; and now, SirHenry, has anything else of interest happened to you since youhave been in London?""Why, no, Mr. Holmes. I think not.""You have not observed anyone follow or watch you?""I seem to have walked right into the thick of a dime novel,"said our visitor. "Why in thunder should anyone follow or watchme?""We are coming to that. You have nothing else to report to usbefore we go into this matter?""Well, it depends upon what you think worth reporting.""I think anything out of the ordinary routine of life well worthreporting."Sir Henry smiled. "I don't know much of British life yet, for Ihave spent nearly all my time in the States and in Canada. But Ihope that to lose one of your boots is not part of the ordinaryroutine of life over here.""You have lost one of your boots?""My dear sir," cried Dr. Mortimer, "it is only mislaid. You willfind it when you return to the hotel. What is the use oftroubling Mr. Holmes with trifles of this kind?""Well, he asked me for anything outside the ordinary routine.""Exactly," said Holmes, "however foolish the incident may seem.You have lost one of your boots, you say?""Well, mislaid it, anyhow. I put them both outside my door lastnight, and there was only one in the morning. I could get nosense out of the chap who cleans them. The worst of it is that Ionly bought the pair last night in the Strand, and I have neverhad them on.""If you have never worn them, why did you put them out to becleaned?""They were tan boots and had never been varnished. That was why Iput them out.""Then I understand that on your arrival in London yesterday youwent out at once and bought a pair of boots?""I did a good deal of shopping. Dr. Mortimer here went round withme. You see, if I am to be squire down there I must dress thepart, and it may be that I have got a little careless in my waysout West. Among other things I bought these brown boots-gave sixdollars for them-and had one stolen before ever I had them on myfeet.""It seems a singularly useless thing to steal," said SherlockHolmes. "I confess that I share Dr. Mortimer's belief that itwill not be long before the missing boot is found.""And, now, gentlemen," said the baronet with decision, "it seemsto me that I have spoken quite enough about the little that Iknow. It is time that you kept your promise and gave me a fullaccount of what we are all driving at.""Your request is a very reasonable one," Holmes answered. "Dr.Mortimer, I think you could not do better than to tell your storyas you told it to us."Thus encouraged, our scientific friend drew his papers from hispocket and presented the whole case as he had done upon themorning before. Sir Henry Baskerville listened with the deepestattention and with an occasional exclamation of surprise."Well, I seem to have come into an inheritance with a vengeance,"said he when the long narrative was finished. "Of course, I'veheard of the hound ever since I was in the nursery. It's the petstory of the family, though I never thought of taking itseriously before. But as to my uncle's death-well, it all seemsboiling up in my head, and I can't get it clear yet. You don'tseem quite to have made up your mind whether it's a case for apoliceman or a clergyman.""Precisely.""And now there's this affair of the letter to me at the hotel. Isuppose that fits into its place.""It seems to show that someone knows more than we do about whatgoes on upon the moor," said Dr. Mortimer."And also," said Holmes, "that someone is not ill-disposedtowards you, since they warn you of danger.""Or it may be that they wish, for their own purposes, to scare meaway.""Well, of course, that is possible also. I am very much indebtedto you, Dr. Mortimer, for introducing me to a problem whichpresents several interesting alternatives. But the practicalpoint which we now have to decide, Sir Henry, is whether it is oris not advisable for you to go to Baskerville Hall.""Why should I not go?""There seems to be danger.""Do you mean danger from this family fiend or do you mean dangerfrom human beings?""Well, that is what we have to find out.""Whichever it is, my answer is fixed. There is no devil in hell,Mr. Holmes, and there is no man upon earth who can prevent mefrom going to the home of my own people, and you may take that tobe my final answer." His dark brows knitted and his face flushedto a dusky red as he spoke. It was evident that the fiery temperof the Baskervilles was not extinct in this their lastrepresentative. "Meanwhile," said he, "I have hardly had time tothink over all that you have told me. It's a big thing for a manto have to understand and to decide at one sitting. I should liketo have a quiet hour by myself to make up my mind. Now, lookhere, Mr. Holmes, it's half-past eleven now and I am going backright away to my hotel. Suppose you and your friend, Dr. Watson,come round and lunch with us at two. I'll be able to tell youmore clearly then how this thing strikes me.""Is that convenient to you, Watson?""Perfectly.""Then you may expect us. Shall I have a cab called?""I'd prefer to walk, for this affair has flurried me rather.""I'll join you in a walk, with pleasure," said his companion."Then we meet again at two o'clock. Au revoir, and good-morning!"We heard the steps of our visitors descend the stair and the bangof the front door. In an instant Holmes had changed from thelanguid dreamer to the man of action."Your hat and boots, Watson, quick! Not a moment to lose!" Herushed into his room in his dressing-gown and was back again in afew seconds in a frock-coat. We hurried together down the stairsand into the street. Dr. Mortimer and Baskerville were stillvisible about two hundred yards ahead of us in the direction ofOxford Street."Shall I run on and stop them?""Not for the world, my dear Watson. I am perfectly satisfied withyour company if you will tolerate mine. Our friends are wise, forit is certainly a very fine morning for a walk."He quickened his pace until we had decreased the distance whichdivided us by about half. Then, still keeping a hundred yardsbehind, we followed into Oxford Street and so down Regent Street.Once our friends stopped and stared into a shop window, uponwhich Holmes did the same. An instant afterwards he gave a littlecry of satisfaction, and, following the direction of his eagereyes, I saw that a hansom cab with a man inside which had haltedon the other side of the street was now proceeding slowly onwardagain."There's our man, Watson! Come along! We'll have a good look athim, if we can do no more."At that instant I was aware of a bushy black beard and a pair ofpiercing eyes turned upon us through the side window of the cab.Instantly the trapdoor at the top flew up, something was screamedto the driver, and the cab flew madly off down Regent Street.Holmes looked eagerly round for another, but no empty one was insight. Then he dashed in wild pursuit amid the stream of thetraffic, but the start was too great, and already the cab was outof sight."There now!" said Holmes bitterly as he emerged panting and whitewith vexation from the tide of vehicles. "Was ever such bad luckand such bad management, too? Watson, Watson, if you are anhonest man you will record this also and set it against mysuccesses!""Who was the man?""I have not an idea.""A spy?""Well, it was evident from what we have heard that Baskervillehas been very closely shadowed by someone since he has been intown. How else could it be known so quickly that it was theNorthumberland Hotel which he had chosen? If they had followedhim the first day I argued that they would follow him also thesecond. You may have observed that I twice strolled over to thewindow while Dr. Mortimer was reading his legend.""Yes, I remember.""I was looking out for loiterers in the street, but I saw none.We are dealing with a clever man, Watson. This matter cuts verydeep, and though I have not finally made up my mind whether it isa benevolent or a malevolent agency which is in touch with us, Iam conscious always of power and design. When our friends left Iat once followed them in the hopes of marking down theirinvisible attendant. So wily was he that he had not trustedhimself upon foot, but he had availed himself of a cab so that hecould loiter behind or dash past them and so escape their notice.His method had the additional advantage that if they were to takea cab he was all ready to follow them. It has, however, oneobvious disadvantage.""It puts him in the power of the cabman.""Exactly.""What a pity we did not get the number!""My dear Watson, clumsy as I have been, you surely do notseriously imagine that I neglected to get the number? No. 2704 isour man. But that is no use to us for the moment.""I fail to see how you could have done more.""On observing the cab I should have instantly turned and walkedin the other direction. I should then at my leisure have hired asecond cab and followed the first at a respectful distance, or,better still, have driven to the Northumberland Hotel and waitedthere. When our unknown had followed Baskerville home we shouldhave had the opportunity of playing his own game upon himself andseeing where he made for. As it is, by an indiscreet eagerness,which was taken advantage of with extraordinary quickness andenergy by our opponent, we have betrayed ourselves and lost ourman."We had been sauntering slowly down Regent Street during thisconversation, and Dr. Mortimer, with his companion, had longvanished in front of us."There is no object in our following them," said Holmes. "Theshadow has departed and will not return. We must see what furthercards we have in our hands and play them with decision. Could youswear to that man's face within the cab?""I could swear only to the beard.""And so could I-from which I gather that in all probability itwas a false one. A clever man upon so delicate an errand has nouse for a beard save to conceal his features. Come in here,Watson!"He turned into one of the district messenger offices, where hewas warmly greeted by the manager."Ah, Wilson, I see you have not forgotten the little case inwhich I had the good fortune to help you?""No, sir, indeed I have not. You saved my good name, and perhapsmy life.""My dear fellow, you exaggerate. I have some recollection,Wilson, that you had among your boys a lad named Cartwright, whoshowed some ability during the investigation.""Yes, sir, he is still with us.""Could you ring him up?-thank you! And I should be glad to havechange of this five-pound note."A lad of fourteen, with a bright, keen face, had obeyed thesummons of the manager. He stood now gazing with great reverenceat the famous detective."Let me have the Hotel Directory," said Holmes. "Thank you! Now,Cartwright, there are the names of twenty-three hotels here, allin the immediate neighbourhood of Charing Cross. Do you see?""Yes, sir.""You will visit each of these in turn.""Yes, sir.""You will begin in each case by giving the outside porter oneshilling. Here are twenty-three shillings.""Yes, sir.""You will tell him that you want to see the waste-paper ofyesterday. You will say that an important telegram has miscarriedand that you are looking for it. You understand?""Yes, sir.""But what you are really looking for is the centre page of the_Times_ with some holes cut in it with scissors. Here is a copyof the _Times_. It is this page. You could easily recognize it,could you not?""Yes, sir.""In each case the outside porter will send for the hall porter,to whom also you will give a shilling. Here are twenty-threeshillings. You will then learn in possibly twenty cases out ofthe twenty-three that the waste of the day before has been burnedor removed. In the three other cases you will be shown a heap ofpaper and you will look for this page of the _Times_ among it.The odds are enormously against your finding it. There are tenshillings over in case of emergencies. Let me have a report bywire at Baker Street before evening. And now, Watson, it onlyremains for us to find out by wire the identity of the cabman,No. 2704, and then we will drop into one of the Bond Streetpicture galleries and fill in the time until we are due at thehotel."Chapter 5.Three Broken ThreadsSherlock Holmes had, in a very remarkable degree, the power ofdetaching his mind at will. For two hours the strange business inwhich we had been involved appeared to be forgotten, and he wasentirely absorbed in the pictures of the modern Belgian masters.He would talk of nothing but art, of which he had the crudestideas, from our leaving the gallery until we found ourselves atthe Northumberland Hotel."Sir Henry Baskerville is upstairs expecting you," said theclerk. "He asked me to show you up at once when you came.""Have you any objection to my looking at your register?" saidHolmes."Not in the least."The book showed that two names had been added after that ofBaskerville. One was Theophilus Johnson and family, of Newcastle;the other Mrs. Oldmore and maid, of High Lodge, Alton."Surely that must be the same Johnson whom I used to know," saidHolmes to the porter. "A lawyer, is he not, grey-headed, andwalks with a limp?""No, sir, this is Mr. Johnson, the coal-owner, a very activegentleman, not older than yourself.""Surely you are mistaken about his trade?""No, sir! he has used this hotel for many years, and he is verywell known to us.""Ah, that settles it. Mrs. Oldmore, too; I seem to remember thename. Excuse my curiosity, but often in calling upon one friendone finds another.""She is an invalid lady, sir. Her husband was once mayor ofGloucester. She always comes to us when she is in town.""Thank you; I am afraid I cannot claim her acquaintance. We haveestablished a most important fact by these questions, Watson," hecontinued in a low voice as we went upstairs together. "We knownow that the people who are so interested in our friend have notsettled down in his own hotel. That means that while they are, aswe have seen, very anxious to watch him, they are equally anxiousthat he should not see them. Now, this is a most suggestivefact.""What does it suggest?""It suggests-halloa, my dear fellow, what on earth is thematter?"As we came round the top of the stairs we had run up against SirHenry Baskerville himself. His face was flushed with anger, andhe held an old and dusty boot in one of his hands. So furious washe that he was hardly articulate, and when he did speak it was ina much broader and more Western dialect than any which we hadheard from him in the morning."Seems to me they are playing me for a sucker in this hotel," hecried. "They'll find they've started in to monkey with the wrongman unless they are careful. By thunder, if that chap can't findmy missing boot there will be trouble. I can take a joke with thebest, Mr. Holmes, but they've got a bit over the mark this time.""Still looking for your boot?""Yes, sir, and mean to find it.""But, surely, you said that it was a new brown boot?""So it was, sir. And now it's an old black one.""What! you don't mean to say-?""That's just what I do mean to say. I only had three pairs in theworld-the new brown, the old black, and the patent leathers,which I am wearing. Last night they took one of my brown ones,and today they have sneaked one of the black. Well, have you gotit? Speak out, man, and don't stand staring!"An agitated German waiter had appeared upon the scene."No, sir; I have made inquiry all over the hotel, but I can hearno word of it.""Well, either that boot comes back before sundown or I'll see themanager and tell him that I go right straight out of this hotel.""It shall be found, sir-I promise you that if you will have alittle patience it will be found.""Mind it is, for it's the last thing of mine that I'll lose inthis den of thieves. Well, well, Mr. Holmes, you'll excuse mytroubling you about such a trifle-""I think it's well worth troubling about.""Why, you look very serious over it.""How do you explain it?""I just don't attempt to explain it. It seems the very maddest,queerest thing that ever happened to me.""The queerest perhaps-" said Holmes thoughtfully."What do you make of it yourself?""Well, I don't profess to understand it yet. This case of yoursis very complex, Sir Henry. When taken in conjunction with youruncle's death I am not sure that of all the five hundred cases ofcapital importance which I have handled there is one which cutsso deep. But we hold several threads in our hands, and the oddsare that one or other of them guides us to the truth. We maywaste time in following the wrong one, but sooner or later wemust come upon the right."We had a pleasant luncheon in which little was said of thebusiness which had brought us together. It was in the privatesitting-room to which we afterwards repaired that Holmes askedBaskerville what were his intentions."To go to Baskerville Hall.""And when?""At the end of the week.""On the whole," said Holmes, "I think that your decision is awise one. I have ample evidence that you are being dogged inLondon, and amid the millions of this great city it is difficultto discover who these people are or what their object can be. Iftheir intentions are evil they might do you a mischief, and weshould be powerless to prevent it. You did not know, Dr.Mortimer, that you were followed this morning from my house?"Dr. Mortimer started violently. "Followed! By whom?""That, unfortunately, is what I cannot tell you. Have you amongyour neighbours or acquaintances on Dartmoor any man with ablack, full beard?""No-or, let me see-why, yes. Barrymore, Sir Charles's butler, isa man with a full, black beard.""Ha! Where is Barrymore?""He is in charge of the Hall.""We had best ascertain if he is really there, or if by anypossibility he might be in London.""How can you do that?""Give me a telegraph form. 'Is all ready for Sir Henry?' Thatwill do. Address to Mr. Barrymore, Baskerville Hall. What is thenearest telegraph-office? Grimpen. Very good, we will send asecond wire to the postmaster, Grimpen: 'Telegram to Mr.Barrymore to be delivered into his own hand. If absent, pleasereturn wire to Sir Henry Baskerville, Northumberland Hotel.' Thatshould let us know before evening whether Barrymore is at hispost in Devonshire or not.""That's so," said Baskerville. "By the way, Dr. Mortimer, who isthis Barrymore, anyhow?""He is the son of the old caretaker, who is dead. They havelooked after the Hall for four generations now. So far as I know,he and his wife are as respectable a couple as any in thecounty.""At the same time," said Baskerville, "it's clear enough that solong as there are none of the family at the Hall these peoplehave a mighty fine home and nothing to do.""That is true.""Did Barrymore profit at all by Sir Charles's will?" askedHolmes."He and his wife had five hundred pounds each.""Ha! Did they know that they would receive this?""Yes; Sir Charles was very fond of talking about the provisionsof his will.""That is very interesting.""I hope," said Dr. Mortimer, "that you do not look withsuspicious eyes upon everyone who received a legacy from SirCharles, for I also had a thousand pounds left to me.""Indeed! And anyone else?""There were many insignificant sums to individuals, and a largenumber of public charities. The residue all went to Sir Henry.""And how much was the residue?""Seven hundred and forty thousand pounds."Holmes raised his eyebrows in surprise. "I had no idea that sogigantic a sum was involved," said he."Sir Charles had the reputation of being rich, but we did notknow how very rich he was until we came to examine hissecurities. The total value of the estate was close on to amillion.""Dear me! It is a stake for which a man might well play adesperate game. And one more question, Dr. Mortimer. Supposingthat anything happened to our young friend here-you will forgivethe unpleasant hypothesis!-who would inherit the estate?""Since Rodger Baskerville, Sir Charles's younger brother diedunmarried, the estate would descend to the Desmonds, who aredistant cousins. James Desmond is an elderly clergyman inWestmoreland.""Thank you. These details are all of great interest. Have you metMr. James Desmond?""Yes; he once came down to visit Sir Charles. He is a man ofvenerable appearance and of saintly life. I remember that herefused to accept any settlement from Sir Charles, though hepressed it upon him.""And this man of simple tastes would be the heir to Sir Charles'sthousands.""He would be the heir to the estate because that is entailed. Hewould also be the heir to the money unless it were willedotherwise by the present owner, who can, of course, do what helikes with it.""And have you made your will, Sir Henry?""No, Mr. Holmes, I have not. I've had no time, for it was onlyyesterday that I learned how matters stood. But in any case Ifeel that the money should go with the title and estate. That wasmy poor uncle's idea. How is the owner going to restore theglories of the Baskervilles if he has not money enough to keep upthe property? House, land, and dollars must go together.""Quite so. Well, Sir Henry, I am of one mind with you as to theadvisability of your going down to Devonshire without delay.There is only one provision which I must make. You certainly mustnot go alone.""Dr. Mortimer returns with me.""But Dr. Mortimer has his practice to attend to, and his house ismiles away from yours. With all the goodwill in the world he maybe unable to help you. No, Sir Henry, you must take with yousomeone, a trusty man, who will be always by your side.""Is it possible that you could come yourself, Mr. Holmes?""If matters came to a crisis I should endeavour to be present inperson; but you can understand that, with my extensive consultingpractice and with the constant appeals which reach me from manyquarters, it is impossible for me to be absent from London for anindefinite time. At the present instant one of the most reverednames in England is being besmirched by a blackmailer, and only Ican stop a disastrous scandal. You will see how impossible it isfor me to go to Dartmoor.""Whom would you recommend, then?"Holmes laid his hand upon my arm. "If my friend would undertakeit there is no man who is better worth having at your side whenyou are in a tight place. No one can say so more confidently thanI."The proposition took me completely by surprise, but before I hadtime to answer, Baskerville seized me by the hand and wrung itheartily."Well, now, that is real kind of you, Dr. Watson," said he. "Yousee how it is with me, and you know just as much about the matteras I do. If you will come down to Baskerville Hall and see methrough I'll never forget it."The promise of adventure had always a fascination for me, and Iwas complimented by the words of Holmes and by the eagerness withwhich the baronet hailed me as a companion."I will come, with pleasure," said I. "I do not know how I couldemploy my time better.""And you will report very carefully to me," said Holmes. "When acrisis comes, as it will do, I will direct how you shall act. Isuppose that by Saturday all might be ready?""Would that suit Dr. Watson?""Perfectly.""Then on Saturday, unless you hear to the contrary, we shall meetat the ten-thirty train from Paddington."We had risen to depart when Baskerville gave a cry of triumph,and diving into one of the corners of the room he drew a brownboot from under a cabinet."My missing boot!" he cried."May all our difficulties vanish as easily!" said SherlockHolmes."But it is a very singular thing," Dr. Mortimer remarked. "Isearched this room carefully before lunch.""And so did I," said Baskerville. "Every inch of it.""There was certainly no boot in it then.""In that case the waiter must have placed it there while we werelunching."The German was sent for but professed to know nothing of thematter, nor could any inquiry clear it up. Another item had beenadded to that constant and apparently purposeless series of smallmysteries which had succeeded each other so rapidly. Settingaside the whole grim story of Sir Charles's death, we had a lineof inexplicable incidents all within the limits of two days,which included the receipt of the printed letter, theblack-bearded spy in the hansom, the loss of the new brown boot,the loss of the old black boot, and now the return of the newbrown boot. Holmes sat in silence in the cab as we drove back toBaker Street, and I knew from his drawn brows and keen face thathis mind, like my own, was busy in endeavouring to frame somescheme into which all these strange and apparently disconnectedepisodes could be fitted. All afternoon and late into the eveninghe sat lost in tobacco and thought.Just before dinner two telegrams were handed in. The first ran:Have just heard that Barrymore is at the Hall. BASKERVILLE.The second:Visited twenty-three hotels as directed, but sorry to reportunable to trace cut sheet of _Times_. CARTWRIGHT."There go two of my threads, Watson. There is nothing morestimulating than a case where everything goes against you. Wemust cast round for another scent.""We have still the cabman who drove the spy.""Exactly. I have wired to get his name and address from theOfficial Registry. I should not be surprised if this were ananswer to my question."The ring at the bell proved to be something even moresatisfactory than an answer, however, for the door opened and arough-looking fellow entered who was evidently the man himself."I got a message from the head office that a gent at this addresshad been inquiring for No. 2704," said he. "I've driven my cabthis seven years and never a word of complaint. I came herestraight from the Yard to ask you to your face what you hadagainst me.""I have nothing in the world against you, my good man," saidHolmes. "On the contrary, I have half a sovereign for you if youwill give me a clear answer to my questions.""Well, I've had a good day and no mistake," said the cabman witha grin. "What was it you wanted to ask, sir?""First of all your name and address, in case I want you again.""John Clayton, 3 Turpey Street, the Borough. My cab is out ofShipley's Yard, near Waterloo Station."Sherlock Holmes made a note of it."Now, Clayton, tell me all about the fare who came and watchedthis house at ten o'clock this morning and afterwards followedthe two gentlemen down Regent Street."The man looked surprised and a little embarrassed. "Why, there'sno good my telling you things, for you seem to know as much as Ido already," said he. "The truth is that the gentleman told methat he was a detective and that I was to say nothing about himto anyone.""My good fellow; this is a very serious business, and you mayfind yourself in a pretty bad position if you try to hideanything from me. You say that your fare told you that he was adetective?""Yes, he did.""When did he say this?""When he left me.""Did he say anything more?""He mentioned his name."Holmes cast a swift glance of triumph at me. "Oh, he mentionedhis name, did he? That was imprudent. What was the name that hementioned?""His name," said the cabman, "was Mr. Sherlock Holmes."Never have I seen my friend more completely taken aback than bythe cabman's reply. For an instant he sat in silent amazement.Then he burst into a hearty laugh."A touch, Watson-an undeniable touch!" said he. "I feel a foil asquick and supple as my own. He got home upon me very prettilythat time. So his name was Sherlock Holmes, was it?""Yes, sir, that was the gentleman's name.""Excellent! Tell me where you picked him up and all thatoccurred.""He hailed me at half-past nine in Trafalgar Square. He said thathe was a detective, and he offered me two guineas if I would doexactly what he wanted all day and ask no questions. I was gladenough to agree. First we drove down to the Northumberland Hoteland waited there until two gentlemen came out and took a cab fromthe rank. We followed their cab until it pulled up somewhere nearhere.""This very door," said Holmes."Well, I couldn't be sure of that, but I dare say my fare knewall about it. We pulled up halfway down the street and waited anhour and a half. Then the two gentlemen passed us, walking, andwe followed down Baker Street and along-""I know," said Holmes."Until we got three-quarters down Regent Street. Then mygentleman threw up the trap, and he cried that I should driveright away to Waterloo Station as hard as I could go. I whippedup the mare and we were there under the ten minutes. Then he paidup his two guineas, like a good one, and away he went into thestation. Only just as he was leaving he turned round and he said:'It might interest you to know that you have been driving Mr.Sherlock Holmes.' That's how I come to know the name.""I see. And you saw no more of him?""Not after he went into the station.""And how would you describe Mr. Sherlock Holmes?"The cabman scratched his head. "Well, he wasn't altogether suchan easy gentleman to describe. I'd put him at forty years of age,and he was of a middle height, two or three inches shorter thanyou, sir. He was dressed like a toff, and he had a black beard,cut square at the end, and a pale face. I don't know as I couldsay more than that.""Colour of his eyes?""No, I can't say that.""Nothing more that you can remember?""No, sir; nothing.""Well, then, here is your half-sovereign. There's another onewaiting for you if you can bring any more information.Good-night!""Good-night, sir, and thank you!"John Clayton departed chuckling, and Holmes turned to me with ashrug of his shoulders and a rueful smile."Snap goes our third thread, and we end where we began," said he."The cunning rascal! He knew our number, knew that Sir HenryBaskerville had consulted me, spotted who I was in Regent Street,conjectured that I had got the number of the cab and would lay myhands on the driver, and so sent back this audacious message. Itell you, Watson, this time we have got a foeman who is worthy ofour steel. I've been checkmated in London. I can only wish youbetter luck in Devonshire. But I'm not easy in my mind about it.""About what?""About sending you. It's an ugly business, Watson, an uglydangerous business, and the more I see of it the less I like it.Yes, my dear fellow, you may laugh, but I give you my word that Ishall be very glad to have you back safe and sound in BakerStreet once more."Chapter 6.Baskerville HallSir Henry Baskerville and Dr. Mortimer were ready upon theappointed day, and we started as arranged for Devonshire. Mr.Sherlock Holmes drove with me to the station and gave me his lastparting injunctions and advice."I will not bias your mind by suggesting theories or suspicions,Watson," said he; "I wish you simply to report facts in thefullest possible manner to me, and you can leave me to do thetheorizing.""What sort of facts?" I asked."Anything which may seem to have a bearing however indirect uponthe case, and especially the relations between young Baskervilleand his neighbours or any fresh particulars concerning the deathof Sir Charles. I have made some inquiries myself in the last fewdays, but the results have, I fear, been negative. One thing onlyappears to be certain, and that is that Mr. James Desmond, who isthe next heir, is an elderly gentleman of a very amiabledisposition, so that this persecution does not arise from him. Ireally think that we may eliminate him entirely from ourcalculations. There remain the people who will actually surroundSir Henry Baskerville upon the moor.""Would it not be well in the first place to get rid of thisBarrymore couple?""By no means. You could not make a greater mistake. If they areinnocent it would be a cruel injustice, and if they are guilty weshould be giving up all chance of bringing it home to them. No,no, we will preserve them upon our list of suspects. Then thereis a groom at the Hall, if I remember right. There are twomoorland farmers. There is our friend Dr. Mortimer, whom Ibelieve to be entirely honest, and there is his wife, of whom weknow nothing. There is this naturalist, Stapleton, and there ishis sister, who is said to be a young lady of attractions. Thereis Mr. Frankland, of Lafter Hall, who is also an unknown factor,and there are one or two other neighbours. These are the folk whomust be your very special study.""I will do my best.""You have arms, I suppose?""Yes, I thought it as well to take them.""Most certainly. Keep your revolver near you night and day, andnever relax your precautions."Our friends had already secured a first-class carriage and werewaiting for us upon the platform."No, we have no news of any kind," said Dr. Mortimer in answer tomy friend's questions. "I can swear to one thing, and that isthat we have not been shadowed during the last two days. We havenever gone out without keeping a sharp watch, and no one couldhave escaped our notice.""You have always kept together, I presume?""Except yesterday afternoon. I usually give up one day to pureamusement when I come to town, so I spent it at the Museum of theCollege of Surgeons.""And I went to look at the folk in the park," said Baskerville."But we had no trouble of any kind.""It was imprudent, all the same," said Holmes, shaking his headand looking very grave. "I beg, Sir Henry, that you will not goabout alone. Some great misfortune will befall you if you do. Didyou get your other boot?""No, sir, it is gone forever.""Indeed. That is very interesting. Well, good-bye," he added asthe train began to glide down the platform. "Bear in mind, SirHenry, one of the phrases in that queer old legend which Dr.Mortimer has read to us, and avoid the moor in those hours ofdarkness when the powers of evil are exalted."I looked back at the platform when we had left it far behind andsaw the tall, austere figure of Holmes standing motionless andgazing after us.The journey was a swift and pleasant one, and I spent it inmaking the more intimate acquaintance of my two companions and inplaying with Dr. Mortimer's spaniel. In a very few hours thebrown earth had become ruddy, the brick had changed to granite,and red cows grazed in well-hedged fields where the lush grassesand more luxuriant vegetation spoke of a richer, if a damper,climate. Young Baskerville stared eagerly out of the window andcried aloud with delight as he recognized the familiar featuresof the Devon scenery."I've been over a good part of the world since I left it, Dr.Watson," said he; "but I have never seen a place to compare withit.""I never saw a Devonshire man who did not swear by his county," Iremarked."It depends upon the breed of men quite as much as on thecounty," said Dr. Mortimer. "A glance at our friend here revealsthe rounded head of the Celt, which carries inside it the Celticenthusiasm and power of attachment. Poor Sir Charles's head wasof a very rare type, half Gaelic, half Ivernian in itscharacteristics. But you were very young when you last sawBaskerville Hall, were you not?""I was a boy in my teens at the time of my father's death and hadnever seen the Hall, for he lived in a little cottage on theSouth Coast. Thence I went straight to a friend in America. Itell you it is all as new to me as it is to Dr. Watson, and I'mas keen as possible to see the moor.""Are you? Then your wish is easily granted, for there is yourfirst sight of the moor," said Dr. Mortimer, pointing out of thecarriage window.Over the green squares of the fields and the low curve of a woodthere rose in the distance a grey, melancholy hill, with astrange jagged summit, dim and vague in the distance, like somefantastic landscape in a dream. Baskerville sat for a long time,his eyes fixed upon it, and I read upon his eager face how muchit meant to him, this first sight of that strange spot where themen of his blood had held sway so long and left their mark sodeep. There he sat, with his tweed suit and his American accent,in the corner of a prosaic railway-carriage, and yet as I lookedat his dark and expressive face I felt more than ever how true adescendant he was of that long line of high-blooded, fiery, andmasterful men. There were pride, valour, and strength in histhick brows, his sensitive nostrils, and his large hazel eyes. Ifon that forbidding moor a difficult and dangerous quest shouldlie before us, this was at least a comrade for whom one mightventure to take a risk with the certainty that he would bravelyshare it.The train pulled up at a small wayside station and we alldescended. Outside, beyond the low, white fence, a wagonette witha pair of cobs was waiting. Our coming was evidently a greatevent, for station-master and porters clustered round us to carryout our luggage. It was a sweet, simple country spot, but I wassurprised to observe that by the gate there stood two soldierlymen in dark uniforms who leaned upon their short rifles andglanced keenly at us as we passed. The coachman, a hard-faced,gnarled little fellow, saluted Sir Henry Baskerville, and in afew minutes we were flying swiftly down the broad, white road.Rolling pasture lands curved upward on either side of us, and oldgabled houses peeped out from amid the thick green foliage, butbehind the peaceful and sunlit countryside there rose ever, darkagainst the evening sky, the long, gloomy curve of the moor,broken by the jagged and sinister hills.The wagonette swung round into a side road, and we curved upwardthrough deep lanes worn by centuries of wheels, high banks oneither side, heavy with dripping moss and fleshy hart's-tongueferns. Bronzing bracken and mottled bramble gleamed in the lightof the sinking sun. Still steadily rising, we passed over anarrow granite bridge and skirted a noisy stream which gushedswiftly down, foaming and roaring amid the grey boulders. Bothroad and stream wound up through a valley dense with scrub oakand fir. At every turn Baskerville gave an exclamation ofdelight, looking eagerly about him and asking countlessquestions. To his eyes all seemed beautiful, but to me a tinge ofmelancholy lay upon the countryside, which bore so clearly themark of the waning year. Yellow leaves carpeted the lanes andfluttered down upon us as we passed. The rattle of our wheelsdied away as we drove through drifts of rotting vegetation-sadgifts, as it seemed to me, for Nature to throw before thecarriage of the returning heir of the Baskervilles."Halloa!" cried Dr. Mortimer, "what is this?"A steep curve of heath-clad land, an outlying spur of the moor,lay in front of us. On the summit, hard and clear like anequestrian statue upon its pedestal, was a mounted soldier, darkand stern, his rifle poised ready over his forearm. He waswatching the road along which we travelled."What is this, Perkins?" asked Dr. Mortimer.Our driver half turned in his seat. "There's a convict escapedfrom Princetown, sir. He's been out three days now, and thewarders watch every road and every station, but they've had nosight of him yet. The farmers about here don't like it, sir, andthat's a fact.""Well, I understand that they get five pounds if they can giveinformation.""Yes, sir, but the chance of five pounds is but a poor thingcompared to the chance of having your throat cut. You see, itisn't like any ordinary convict. This is a man that would stickat nothing.""Who is he, then?""It is Selden, the Notting Hill murderer."I remembered the case well, for it was one in which Holmes hadtaken an interest on account of the peculiar ferocity of thecrime and the wanton brutality which had marked all the actionsof the assassin. The commutation of his death sentence had beendue to some doubts as to his complete sanity, so atrocious washis conduct. Our wagonette had topped a rise and in front of usrose the huge expanse of the moor, mottled with gnarled andcraggy cairns and tors. A cold wind swept down from it and set usshivering. Somewhere there, on that desolate plain, was lurkingthis fiendish man, hiding in a burrow like a wild beast, hisheart full of malignancy against the whole race which had casthim out. It needed but this to complete the grim suggestivenessof the barren waste, the chilling wind, and the darkling sky.Even Baskerville fell silent and pulled his overcoat more closelyaround him.We had left the fertile country behind and beneath us. We lookedback on it now, the slanting rays of a low sun turning thestreams to threads of gold and glowing on the red earth newturned by the plough and the broad tangle of the woodlands. Theroad in front of us grew bleaker and wilder over huge russet andolive slopes, sprinkled with giant boulders. Now and then wepassed a moorland cottage, walled and roofed with stone, with nocreeper to break its harsh outline. Suddenly we looked down intoa cuplike depression, patched with stunted oaks and firs whichhad been twisted and bent by the fury of years of storm. Twohigh, narrow towers rose over the trees. The driver pointed withhis whip."Baskerville Hall," said he.Its master had risen and was staring with flushed cheeks andshining eyes. A few minutes later we had reached the lodge-gates,a maze of fantastic tracery in wrought iron, with weather-bittenpillars on either side, blotched with lichens, and surmounted bythe boars' heads of the Baskervilles. The lodge was a ruin ofblack granite and bared ribs of rafters, but facing it was a newbuilding, half constructed, the first fruit of Sir Charles'sSouth African gold.Through the gateway we passed into the avenue, where the wheelswere again hushed amid the leaves, and the old trees shot theirbranches in a sombre tunnel over our heads. Baskerville shudderedas he looked up the long, dark drive to where the house glimmeredlike a ghost at the farther end."Was it here?" he asked in a low voice."No, no, the yew alley is on the other side."The young heir glanced round with a gloomy face."It's no wonder my uncle felt as if trouble were coming on him insuch a place as this," said he. "It's enough to scare any man.I'll have a row of electric lamps up here inside of six months,and you won't know it again, with a thousand candle-power Swanand Edison right here in front of the hall door."The avenue opened into a broad expanse of turf, and the house laybefore us. In the fading light I could see that the centre was aheavy block of building from which a porch projected. The wholefront was draped in ivy, with a patch clipped bare here and therewhere a window or a coat of arms broke through the dark veil.From this central block rose the twin towers, ancient,crenelated, and pierced with many loopholes. To right and left ofthe turrets were more modern wings of black granite. A dull lightshone through heavy mullioned windows, and from the high chimneyswhich rose from the steep, high-angled roof there sprang a singleblack column of smoke."Welcome, Sir Henry! Welcome to Baskerville Hall!"A tall man had stepped from the shadow of the porch to open thedoor of the wagonette. The figure of a woman was silhouettedagainst the yellow light of the hall. She came out and helped theman to hand down our bags."You don't mind my driving straight home, Sir Henry?" said Dr.Mortimer. "My wife is expecting me.""Surely you will stay and have some dinner?""No, I must go. I shall probably find some work awaiting me. Iwould stay to show you over the house, but Barrymore will be abetter guide than I. Good-bye, and never hesitate night or day tosend for me if I can be of service."The wheels died away down the drive while Sir Henry and I turnedinto the hall, and the door clanged heavily behind us. It was afine apartment in which we found ourselves, large, lofty, andheavily raftered with huge baulks of age-blackened oak. In thegreat old-fashioned fireplace behind the high iron dogs alog-fire crackled and snapped. Sir Henry and I held out our handsto it, for we were numb from our long drive. Then we gazed roundus at the high, thin window of old stained glass, the oakpanelling, the stags' heads, the coats of arms upon the walls,all dim and sombre in the subdued light of the central lamp."It's just as I imagined it," said Sir Henry. "Is it not the verypicture of an old family home? To think that this should be thesame hall in which for five hundred years my people have lived.It strikes me solemn to think of it."I saw his dark face lit up with a boyish enthusiasm as he gazedabout him. The light beat upon him where he stood, but longshadows trailed down the walls and hung like a black canopy abovehim. Barrymore had returned from taking our luggage to our rooms.He stood in front of us now with the subdued manner of awell-trained servant. He was a remarkable-looking man, tall,handsome, with a square black beard and pale, distinguishedfeatures."Would you wish dinner to be served at once, sir?""Is it ready?""In a very few minutes, sir. You will find hot water in yourrooms. My wife and I will be happy, Sir Henry, to stay with youuntil you have made your fresh arrangements, but you willunderstand that under the new conditions this house will requirea considerable staff.""What new conditions?""I only meant, sir, that Sir Charles led a very retired life, andwe were able to look after his wants. You would, naturally, wishto have more company, and so you will need changes in yourhousehold.""Do you mean that your wife and you wish to leave?""Only when it is quite convenient to you, sir.""But your family have been with us for several generations, havethey not? I should be sorry to begin my life here by breaking anold family connection."I seemed to discern some signs of emotion upon the butler's whiteface."I feel that also, sir, and so does my wife. But to tell thetruth, sir, we were both very much attached to Sir Charles, andhis death gave us a shock and made these surroundings verypainful to us. I fear that we shall never again be easy in ourminds at Baskerville Hall.""But what do you intend to do?""I have no doubt, sir, that we shall succeed in establishingourselves in some business. Sir Charles's generosity has given usthe means to do so. And now, sir, perhaps I had best show you toyour rooms."A square balustraded gallery ran round the top of the old hall,approached by a double stair. From this central point two longcorridors extended the whole length of the building, from whichall the bedrooms opened. My own was in the same wing asBaskerville's and almost next door to it. These rooms appeared tobe much more modern than the central part of the house, and thebright paper and numerous candles did something to remove thesombre impression which our arrival had left upon my mind.But the dining-room which opened out of the hall was a place ofshadow and gloom. It was a long chamber with a step separatingthe dais where the family sat from the lower portion reserved fortheir dependents. At one end a minstrel's gallery overlooked it.Black beams shot across above our heads, with a smoke-darkenedceiling beyond them. With rows of flaring torches to light it up,and the colour and rude hilarity of an old-time banquet, it mighthave softened; but now, when two black-clothed gentlemen sat inthe little circle of light thrown by a shaded lamp, one's voicebecame hushed and one's spirit subdued. A dim line of ancestors,in every variety of dress, from the Elizabethan knight to thebuck of the Regency, stared down upon us and daunted us by theirsilent company. We talked little, and I for one was glad when themeal was over and we were able to retire into the modernbilliard-room and smoke a cigarette."My word, it isn't a very cheerful place," said Sir Henry. "Isuppose one can tone down to it, but I feel a bit out of thepicture at present. I don't wonder that my uncle got a littlejumpy if he lived all alone in such a house as this. However, ifit suits you, we will retire early tonight, and perhaps thingsmay seem more cheerful in the morning."I drew aside my curtains before I went to bed and looked out frommy window. It opened upon the grassy space which lay in front ofthe hall door. Beyond, two copses of trees moaned and swung in arising wind. A half moon broke through the rifts of racingclouds. In its cold light I saw beyond the trees a broken fringeof rocks, and the long, low curve of the melancholy moor. Iclosed the curtain, feeling that my last impression was inkeeping with the rest.And yet it was not quite the last. I found myself weary and yetwakeful, tossing restlessly from side to side, seeking for thesleep which would not come. Far away a chiming clock struck outthe quarters of the hours, but otherwise a deathly silence layupon the old house. And then suddenly, in the very dead of thenight, there came a sound to my ears, clear, resonant, andunmistakable. It was the sob of a woman, the muffled, stranglinggasp of one who is torn by an uncontrollable sorrow. I sat up inbed and listened intently. The noise could not have been far awayand was certainly in the house. For half an hour I waited withevery nerve on the alert, but there came no other sound save thechiming clock and the rustle of the ivy on the wall.Chapter 7.The Stapletons of Merripit HouseThe fresh beauty of the following morning did something to effacefrom our minds the grim and grey impression which had been leftupon both of us by our first experience of Baskerville Hall. AsSir Henry and I sat at breakfast the sunlight flooded in throughthe high mullioned windows, throwing watery patches of colourfrom the coats of arms which covered them. The dark panellingglowed like bronze in the golden rays, and it was hard to realisethat this was indeed the chamber which had struck such a gloominto our souls upon the evening before."I guess it is ourselves and not the house that we have toblame!" said the baronet. "We were tired with our journey andchilled by our drive, so we took a grey view of the place. Now weare fresh and well, so it is all cheerful once more.""And yet it was not entirely a question of imagination," Ianswered. "Did you, for example, happen to hear someone, a womanI think, sobbing in the night?""That is curious, for I did when I was half asleep fancy that Iheard something of the sort. I waited quite a time, but there wasno more of it, so I concluded that it was all a dream.""I heard it distinctly, and I am sure that it was really the sobof a woman.""We must ask about this right away." He rang the bell and askedBarrymore whether he could account for our experience. It seemedto me that the pallid features of the butler turned a shade palerstill as he listened to his master's question."There are only two women in the house, Sir Henry," he answered."One is the scullery-maid, who sleeps in the other wing. Theother is my wife, and I can answer for it that the sound couldnot have come from her."And yet he lied as he said it, for it chanced that afterbreakfast I met Mrs. Barrymore in the long corridor with the sunfull upon her face. She was a large, impassive, heavy-featuredwoman with a stern set expression of mouth. But her telltale eyeswere red and glanced at me from between swollen lids. It was she,then, who wept in the night, and if she did so her husband mustknow it. Yet he had taken the obvious risk of discovery indeclaring that it was not so. Why had he done this? And why didshe weep so bitterly? Already round this pale-faced, handsome,black-bearded man there was gathering an atmosphere of mysteryand of gloom. It was he who had been the first to discover thebody of Sir Charles, and we had only his word for all thecircumstances which led up to the old man's death. Was itpossible that it was Barrymore, after all, whom we had seen inthe cab in Regent Street? The beard might well have been thesame. The cabman had described a somewhat shorter man, but suchan impression might easily have been erroneous. How could Isettle the point forever? Obviously the first thing to do was tosee the Grimpen postmaster and find whether the test telegram hadreally been placed in Barrymore's own hands. Be the answer whatit might, I should at least have something to report to SherlockHolmes.Sir Henry had numerous papers to examine after breakfast, so thatthe time was propitious for my excursion. It was a pleasant walkof four miles along the edge of the moor, leading me at last to asmall grey hamlet, in which two larger buildings, which proved tobe the inn and the house of Dr. Mortimer, stood high above therest. The postmaster, who was also the village grocer, had aclear recollection of the telegram."Certainly, sir," said he, "I had the telegram delivered to Mr.Barrymore exactly as directed.""Who delivered it?""My boy here. James, you delivered that telegram to Mr. Barrymoreat the Hall last week, did you not?""Yes, father, I delivered it.""Into his own hands?" I asked."Well, he was up in the loft at the time, so that I could not putit into his own hands, but I gave it into Mrs. Barrymore's hands,and she promised to deliver it at once.""Did you see Mr. Barrymore?""No, sir; I tell you he was in the loft.""If you didn't see him, how do you know he was in the loft?""Well, surely his own wife ought to know where he is," said thepostmaster testily. "Didn't he get the telegram? If there is anymistake it is for Mr. Barrymore himself to complain."It seemed hopeless to pursue the inquiry any farther, but it wasclear that in spite of Holmes's ruse we had no proof thatBarrymore had not been in London all the time. Suppose that itwere so-suppose that the same man had been the last who had seenSir Charles alive, and the first to dog the new heir when hereturned to England. What then? Was he the agent of others or hadhe some sinister design of his own? What interest could he havein persecuting the Baskerville family? I thought of the strangewarning clipped out of the leading article of the _Times_. Wasthat his work or was it possibly the doing of someone who wasbent upon counteracting his schemes? The only conceivable motivewas that which had been suggested by Sir Henry, that if thefamily could be scared away a comfortable and permanent homewould be secured for the Barrymores. But surely such anexplanation as that would be quite inadequate to account for thedeep and subtle scheming which seemed to be weaving an invisiblenet round the young baronet. Holmes himself had said that no morecomplex case had come to him in all the long series of hissensational investigations. I prayed, as I walked back along thegrey, lonely road, that my friend might soon be freed from hispreoccupations and able to come down to take this heavy burden ofresponsibility from my shoulders.Suddenly my thoughts were interrupted by the sound of runningfeet behind me and by a voice which called me by name. I turned,expecting to see Dr. Mortimer, but to my surprise it was astranger who was pursuing me. He was a small, slim, clean-shaven,prim-faced man, flaxen-haired and lean-jawed, between thirty andforty years of age, dressed in a grey suit and wearing a strawhat. A tin box for botanical specimens hung over his shoulder andhe carried a green butterfly-net in one of his hands."You will, I am sure, excuse my presumption, Dr. Watson," said heas he came panting up to where I stood. "Here on the moor we arehomely folk and do not wait for formal introductions. You maypossibly have heard my name from our mutual friend, Mortimer. Iam Stapleton, of Merripit House.""Your net and box would have told me as much," said I, "for Iknew that Mr. Stapleton was a naturalist. But how did you knowme?""I have been calling on Mortimer, and he pointed you out to mefrom the window of his surgery as you passed. As our road lay thesame way I thought that I would overtake you and introducemyself. I trust that Sir Henry is none the worse for hisjourney?""He is very well, thank you.""We were all rather afraid that after the sad death of SirCharles the new baronet might refuse to live here. It is askingmuch of a wealthy man to come down and bury himself in a place ofthis kind, but I need not tell you that it means a very greatdeal to the countryside. Sir Henry has, I suppose, nosuperstitious fears in the matter?""I do not think that it is likely.""Of course you know the legend of the fiend dog which haunts thefamily?""I have heard it.""It is extraordinary how credulous the peasants are about here!Any number of them are ready to swear that they have seen such acreature upon the moor." He spoke with a smile, but I seemed toread in his eyes that he took the matter more seriously. "Thestory took a great hold upon the imagination of Sir Charles, andI have no doubt that it led to his tragic end.""But how?""His nerves were so worked up that the appearance of any dogmight have had a fatal effect upon his diseased heart. I fancythat he really did see something of the kind upon that last nightin the yew alley. I feared that some disaster might occur, for Iwas very fond of the old man, and I knew that his heart wasweak.""How did you know that?""My friend Mortimer told me.""You think, then, that some dog pursued Sir Charles, and that hedied of fright in consequence?""Have you any better explanation?""I have not come to any conclusion.""Has Mr. Sherlock Holmes?"The words took away my breath for an instant but a glance at theplacid face and steadfast eyes of my companion showed that nosurprise was intended."It is useless for us to pretend that we do not know you, Dr.Watson," said he. "The records of your detective have reached ushere, and you could not celebrate him without being knownyourself. When Mortimer told me your name he could not deny youridentity. If you are here, then it follows that Mr. SherlockHolmes is interesting himself in the matter, and I am naturallycurious to know what view he may take.""I am afraid that I cannot answer that question.""May I ask if he is going to honour us with a visit himself?""He cannot leave town at present. He has other cases which engagehis attention.""What a pity! He might throw some light on that which is so darkto us. But as to your own researches, if there is any possibleway in which I can be of service to you I trust that you willcommand me. If I had any indication of the nature of yoursuspicions or how you propose to investigate the case, I mightperhaps even now give you some aid or advice.""I assure you that I am simply here upon a visit to my friend,Sir Henry, and that I need no help of any kind.""Excellent!" said Stapleton. "You are perfectly right to be waryand discreet. I am justly reproved for what I feel was anunjustifiable intrusion, and I promise you that I will notmention the matter again."We had come to a point where a narrow grassy path struck off fromthe road and wound away across the moor. A steep,boulder-sprinkled hill lay upon the right which had in bygonedays been cut into a granite quarry. The face which was turnedtowards us formed a dark cliff, with ferns and brambles growingin its niches. From over a distant rise there floated a greyplume of smoke."A moderate walk along this moor-path brings us to MerripitHouse," said he. "Perhaps you will spare an hour that I may havethe pleasure of introducing you to my sister."My first thought was that I should be by Sir Henry's side. Butthen I remembered the pile of papers and bills with which hisstudy table was littered. It was certain that I could not helpwith those. And Holmes had expressly said that I should study theneighbours upon the moor. I accepted Stapleton's invitation, andwe turned together down the path."It is a wonderful place, the moor," said he, looking round overthe undulating downs, long green rollers, with crests of jaggedgranite foaming up into fantastic surges. "You never tire of themoor. You cannot think the wonderful secrets which it contains.It is so vast, and so barren, and so mysterious.""You know it well, then?""I have only been here two years. The residents would call me anewcomer. We came shortly after Sir Charles settled. But mytastes led me to explore every part of the country round, and Ishould think that there are few men who know it better than Ido.""Is it hard to know?""Very hard. You see, for example, this great plain to the northhere with the queer hills breaking out of it. Do you observeanything remarkable about that?""It would be a rare place for a gallop.""You would naturally think so and the thought has cost severaltheir lives before now. You notice those bright green spotsscattered thickly over it?""Yes, they seem more fertile than the rest."Stapleton laughed. "That is the great Grimpen Mire," said he. "Afalse step yonder means death to man or beast. Only yesterday Isaw one of the moor ponies wander into it. He never came out. Isaw his head for quite a long time craning out of the bog-hole,but it sucked him down at last. Even in dry seasons it is adanger to cross it, but after these autumn rains it is an awfulplace. And yet I can find my way to the very heart of it andreturn alive. By George, there is another of those miserableponies!"Something brown was rolling and tossing among the green sedges.Then a long, agonised, writhing neck shot upward and a dreadfulcry echoed over the moor. It turned me cold with horror, but mycompanion's nerves seemed to be stronger than mine."It's gone!" said he. "The mire has him. Two in two days, andmany more, perhaps, for they get in the way of going there in thedry weather and never know the difference until the mire has themin its clutches. It's a bad place, the great Grimpen Mire.""And you say you can penetrate it?""Yes, there are one or two paths which a very active man cantake. I have found them out.""But why should you wish to go into so horrible a place?""Well, you see the hills beyond? They are really islands cut offon all sides by the impassable mire, which has crawled round themin the course of years. That is where the rare plants and thebutterflies are, if you have the wit to reach them.""I shall try my luck some day."He looked at me with a surprised face. "For God's sake put suchan idea out of your mind," said he. "Your blood would be upon myhead. I assure you that there would not be the least chance ofyour coming back alive. It is only by remembering certain complexlandmarks that I am able to do it.""Halloa!" I cried. "What is that?"A long, low moan, indescribably sad, swept over the moor. Itfilled the whole air, and yet it was impossible to say whence itcame. From a dull murmur it swelled into a deep roar, and thensank back into a melancholy, throbbing murmur once again.Stapleton looked at me with a curious expression in his face."Queer place, the moor!" said he."But what is it?""The peasants say it is the Hound of the Baskervilles calling forits prey. I've heard it once or twice before, but never quite soloud."I looked round, with a chill of fear in my heart, at the hugeswelling plain, mottled with the green patches of rushes. Nothingstirred over the vast expanse save a pair of ravens, whichcroaked loudly from a tor behind us."You are an educated man. You don't believe such nonsense asthat?" said I. "What do you think is the cause of so strange asound?""Bogs make queer noises sometimes. It's the mud settling, or thewater rising, or something.""No, no, that was a living voice.""Well, perhaps it was. Did you ever hear a bittern booming?""No, I never did.""It's a very rare bird-practically extinct-in England now, butall things are possible upon the moor. Yes, I should not besurprised to learn that what we have heard is the cry of the lastof the bitterns.""It's the weirdest, strangest thing that ever I heard in mylife.""Yes, it's rather an uncanny place altogether. Look at thehillside yonder. What do you make of those?"The whole steep slope was covered with grey circular rings ofstone, a score of them at least."What are they? Sheep-pens?""No, they are the homes of our worthy ancestors. Prehistoric manlived thickly on the moor, and as no one in particular has livedthere since, we find all his little arrangements exactly as heleft them. These are his wigwams with the roofs off. You can evensee his hearth and his couch if you have the curiosity to goinside."But it is quite a town. When was it inhabited?""Neolithic man-no date.""What did he do?""He grazed his cattle on these slopes, and he learned to dig fortin when the bronze sword began to supersede the stone axe. Lookat the great trench in the opposite hill. That is his mark. Yes,you will find some very singular points about the moor, Dr.Watson. Oh, excuse me an instant! It is surely Cyclopides."A small fly or moth had fluttered across our path, and in aninstant Stapleton was rushing with extraordinary energy and speedin pursuit of it. To my dismay the creature flew straight for thegreat mire, and my acquaintance never paused for an instant,bounding from tuft to tuft behind it, his green net waving in theair. His grey clothes and jerky, zigzag, irregular progress madehim not unlike some huge moth himself. I was standing watchinghis pursuit with a mixture of admiration for his extraordinaryactivity and fear lest he should lose his footing in thetreacherous mire, when I heard the sound of steps and, turninground, found a woman near me upon the path. She had come from thedirection in which the plume of smoke indicated the position ofMerripit House, but the dip of the moor had hid her until she wasquite close.I could not doubt that this was the Miss Stapleton of whom I hadbeen told, since ladies of any sort must be few upon the moor,and I remembered that I had heard someone describe her as being abeauty. The woman who approached me was certainly that, and of amost uncommon type. There could not have been a greater contrastbetween brother and sister, for Stapleton was neutral tinted,with light hair and grey eyes, while she was darker than anybrunette whom I have seen in England-slim, elegant, and tall. Shehad a proud, finely cut face, so regular that it might haveseemed impassive were it not for the sensitive mouth and thebeautiful dark, eager eyes. With her perfect figure and elegantdress she was, indeed, a strange apparition upon a lonelymoorland path. Her eyes were on her brother as I turned, and thenshe quickened her pace towards me. I had raised my hat and wasabout to make some explanatory remark when her own words turnedall my thoughts into a new channel."Go back!" she said. "Go straight back to London, instantly."I could only stare at her in stupid surprise. Her eyes blazed atme, and she tapped the ground impatiently with her foot."Why should I go back?" I asked."I cannot explain." She spoke in a low, eager voice, with acurious lisp in her utterance. "But for God's sake do what I askyou. Go back and never set foot upon the moor again.""But I have only just come.""Man, man!" she cried. "Can you not tell when a warning is foryour own good? Go back to London! Start tonight! Get away fromthis place at all costs! Hush, my brother is coming! Not a wordof what I have said. Would you mind getting that orchid for meamong the mare's-tails yonder? We are very rich in orchids on themoor, though, of course, you are rather late to see the beautiesof the place."Stapleton had abandoned the chase and came back to us breathinghard and flushed with his exertions."Halloa, Beryl!" said he, and it seemed to me that the tone ofhis greeting was not altogether a cordial one."Well, Jack, you are very hot.""Yes, I was chasing a Cyclopides. He is very rare and seldomfound in the late autumn. What a pity that I should have missedhim!" He spoke unconcernedly, but his small light eyes glancedincessantly from the girl to me."You have introduced yourselves, I can see.""Yes. I was telling Sir Henry that it was rather late for him tosee the true beauties of the moor.""Why, who do you think this is?""I imagine that it must be Sir Henry Baskerville.""No, no," said I. "Only a humble commoner, but his friend. Myname is Dr. Watson."A flush of vexation passed over her expressive face. "We havebeen talking at cross purposes," said she."Why, you had not very much time for talk," her brother remarkedwith the same questioning eyes."I talked as if Dr. Watson were a resident instead of beingmerely a visitor," said she. "It cannot much matter to himwhether it is early or late for the orchids. But you will comeon, will you not, and see Merripit House?"A short walk brought us to it, a bleak moorland house, once thefarm of some grazier in the old prosperous days, but now put intorepair and turned into a modern dwelling. An orchard surroundedit, but the trees, as is usual upon the moor, were stunted andnipped, and the effect of the whole place was mean andmelancholy. We were admitted by a strange, wizened, rusty-coatedold manservant, who seemed in keeping with the house. Inside,however, there were large rooms furnished with an elegance inwhich I seemed to recognize the taste of the lady. As I lookedfrom their windows at the interminable granite-flecked moorrolling unbroken to the farthest horizon I could not but marvelat what could have brought this highly educated man and thisbeautiful woman to live in such a place."Queer spot to choose, is it not?" said he as if in answer to mythought. "And yet we manage to make ourselves fairly happy, do wenot, Beryl?""Quite happy," said she, but there was no ring of conviction inher words."I had a school," said Stapleton. "It was in the north country.The work to a man of my temperament was mechanical anduninteresting, but the privilege of living with youth, of helpingto mould those young minds, and of impressing them with one's owncharacter and ideals was very dear to me. However, the fates wereagainst us. A serious epidemic broke out in the school and threeof the boys died. It never recovered from the blow, and much ofmy capital was irretrievably swallowed up. And yet, if it werenot for the loss of the charming companionship of the boys, Icould rejoice over my own misfortune, for, with my strong tastesfor botany and zoology, I find an unlimited field of work here,and my sister is as devoted to Nature as I am. All this, Dr.Watson, has been brought upon your head by your expression as yousurveyed the moor out of our window.""It certainly did cross my mind that it might be a littledull-less for you, perhaps, than for your sister.""No, no, I am never dull," said she quickly."We have books, we have our studies, and we have interestingneighbours. Dr. Mortimer is a most learned man in his own line.Poor Sir Charles was also an admirable companion. We knew himwell and miss him more than I can tell. Do you think that Ishould intrude if I were to call this afternoon and make theacquaintance of Sir Henry?""I am sure that he would be delighted.""Then perhaps you would mention that I propose to do so. We mayin our humble way do something to make things more easy for himuntil he becomes accustomed to his new surroundings. Will youcome upstairs, Dr. Watson, and inspect my collection ofLepidoptera? I think it is the most complete one in thesouth-west of England. By the time that you have looked throughthem lunch will be almost ready."But I was eager to get back to my charge. The melancholy of themoor, the death of the unfortunate pony, the weird sound whichhad been associated with the grim legend of the Baskervilles, allthese things tinged my thoughts with sadness. Then on the top ofthese more or less vague impressions there had come the definiteand distinct warning of Miss Stapleton, delivered with suchintense earnestness that I could not doubt that some grave anddeep reason lay behind it. I resisted all pressure to stay forlunch, and I set off at once upon my return journey, taking thegrass-grown path by which we had come.It seems, however, that there must have been some short cut forthose who knew it, for before I had reached the road I wasastounded to see Miss Stapleton sitting upon a rock by the sideof the track. Her face was beautifully flushed with her exertionsand she held her hand to her side."I have run all the way in order to cut you off, Dr. Watson,"said she. "I had not even time to put on my hat. I must not stop,or my brother may miss me. I wanted to say to you how sorry I amabout the stupid mistake I made in thinking that you were SirHenry. Please forget the words I said, which have no applicationwhatever to you.""But I can't forget them, Miss Stapleton," said I. "I am SirHenry's friend, and his welfare is a very close concern of mine.Tell me why it was that you were so eager that Sir Henry shouldreturn to London.""A woman's whim, Dr. Watson. When you know me better you willunderstand that I cannot always give reasons for what I say ordo.""No, no. I remember the thrill in your voice. I remember the lookin your eyes. Please, please, be frank with me, Miss Stapleton,for ever since I have been here I have been conscious of shadowsall round me. Life has become like that great Grimpen Mire, withlittle green patches everywhere into which one may sink and withno guide to point the track. Tell me then what it was that youmeant, and I will promise to convey your warning to Sir Henry."An expression of irresolution passed for an instant over herface, but her eyes had hardened again when she answered me."You make too much of it, Dr. Watson," said she. "My brother andI were very much shocked by the death of Sir Charles. We knew himvery intimately, for his favourite walk was over the moor to ourhouse. He was deeply impressed with the curse which hung over thefamily, and when this tragedy came I naturally felt that theremust be some grounds for the fears which he had expressed. I wasdistressed therefore when another member of the family came downto live here, and I felt that he should be warned of the dangerwhich he will run. That was all which I intended to convey."But what is the danger?""You know the story of the hound?""I do not believe in such nonsense.""But I do. If you have any influence with Sir Henry, take himaway from a place which has always been fatal to his family. Theworld is wide. Why should he wish to live at the place ofdanger?""Because it _is_ the place of danger. That is Sir Henry's nature.I fear that unless you can give me some more definite informationthan this it would be impossible to get him to move.""I cannot say anything definite, for I do not know anythingdefinite.""I would ask you one more question, Miss Stapleton. If you meantno more than this when you first spoke to me, why should you notwish your brother to overhear what you said? There is nothing towhich he, or anyone else, could object.""My brother is very anxious to have the Hall inhabited, for hethinks it is for the good of the poor folk upon the moor. Hewould be very angry if he knew that I have said anything whichmight induce Sir Henry to go away. But I have done my duty nowand I will say no more. I must go back, or he will miss me andsuspect that I have seen you. Good-bye!" She turned and haddisappeared in a few minutes among the scattered boulders, whileI, with my soul full of vague fears, pursued my way toBaskerville Hall.Chapter 8.First Report of Dr. WatsonFrom this point onward I will follow the course of events bytranscribing my own letters to Mr. Sherlock Holmes which liebefore me on the table. One page is missing, but otherwise theyare exactly as written and show my feelings and suspicions of themoment more accurately than my memory, clear as it is upon thesetragic events, can possibly do.Baskerville Hall, October 13th.MY DEAR HOLMES,My previous letters and telegrams have kept you pretty well up todate as to all that has occurred in this most God-forsaken cornerof the world. The longer one stays here the more does the spiritof the moor sink into one's soul, its vastness, and also its grimcharm. When you are once out upon its bosom you have left alltraces of modern England behind you, but, on the other hand, youare conscious everywhere of the homes and the work of theprehistoric people. On all sides of you as you walk are thehouses of these forgotten folk, with their graves and the hugemonoliths which are supposed to have marked their temples. As youlook at their grey stone huts against the scarred hillsides youleave your own age behind you, and if you were to see askin-clad, hairy man crawl out from the low door fitting aflint-tipped arrow on to the string of his bow, you would feelthat his presence there was more natural than your own. Thestrange thing is that they should have lived so thickly on whatmust always have been most unfruitful soil. I am no antiquarian,but I could imagine that they were some unwarlike and harriedrace who were forced to accept that which none other wouldoccupy.All this, however, is foreign to the mission on which you sent meand will probably be very uninteresting to your severelypractical mind. I can still remember your complete indifferenceas to whether the sun moved round the earth or the earth roundthe sun. Let me, therefore, return to the facts concerning SirHenry Baskerville.If you have not had any report within the last few days it isbecause up to today there was nothing of importance to relate.Then a very surprising circumstance occurred, which I shall tellyou in due course. But, first of all, I must keep you in touchwith some of the other factors in the situation.One of these, concerning which I have said little, is the escapedconvict upon the moor. There is strong reason now to believe thathe has got right away, which is a considerable relief to thelonely householders of this district. A fortnight has passedsince his flight, during which he has not been seen and nothinghas been heard of him. It is surely inconceivable that he couldhave held out upon the moor during all that time. Of course, sofar as his concealment goes there is no difficulty at all. Anyone of these stone huts would give him a hiding-place. But thereis nothing to eat unless he were to catch and slaughter one ofthe moor sheep. We think, therefore, that he has gone, and theoutlying farmers sleep the better in consequence.We are four able-bodied men in this household, so that we couldtake good care of ourselves, but I confess that I have had uneasymoments when I have thought of the Stapletons. They live milesfrom any help. There are one maid, an old manservant, the sister,and the brother, the latter not a very strong man. They would behelpless in the hands of a desperate fellow like this NottingHill criminal if he could once effect an entrance. Both Sir Henryand I were concerned at their situation, and it was suggestedthat Perkins the groom should go over to sleep there, butStapleton would not hear of it.The fact is that our friend, the baronet, begins to display aconsiderable interest in our fair neighbour. It is not to bewondered at, for time hangs heavily in this lonely spot to anactive man like him, and she is a very fascinating and beautifulwoman. There is something tropical and exotic about her whichforms a singular contrast to her cool and unemotional brother.Yet he also gives the idea of hidden fires. He has certainly avery marked influence over her, for I have seen her continuallyglance at him as she talked as if seeking approbation for whatshe said. I trust that he is kind to her. There is a dry glitterin his eyes and a firm set of his thin lips, which goes with apositive and possibly a harsh nature. You would find him aninteresting study.He came over to call upon Baskerville on that first day, and thevery next morning he took us both to show us the spot where thelegend of the wicked Hugo is supposed to have had its origin. Itwas an excursion of some miles across the moor to a place whichis so dismal that it might have suggested the story. We found ashort valley between rugged tors which led to an open, grassyspace flecked over with the white cotton grass. In the middle ofit rose two great stones, worn and sharpened at the upper enduntil they looked like the huge corroding fangs of some monstrousbeast. In every way it corresponded with the scene of the oldtragedy. Sir Henry was much interested and asked Stapleton morethan once whether he did really believe in the possibility of theinterference of the supernatural in the affairs of men. He spokelightly, but it was evident that he was very much in earnest.Stapleton was guarded in his replies, but it was easy to see thathe said less than he might, and that he would not express hiswhole opinion out of consideration for the feelings of thebaronet. He told us of similar cases, where families had sufferedfrom some evil influence, and he left us with the impression thathe shared the popular view upon the matter.On our way back we stayed for lunch at Merripit House, and it wasthere that Sir Henry made the acquaintance of Miss Stapleton.From the first moment that he saw her he appeared to be stronglyattracted by her, and I am much mistaken if the feeling was notmutual. He referred to her again and again on our walk home, andsince then hardly a day has passed that we have not seensomething of the brother and sister. They dine here tonight, andthere is some talk of our going to them next week. One wouldimagine that such a match would be very welcome to Stapleton, andyet I have more than once caught a look of the strongestdisapprobation in his face when Sir Henry has been paying someattention to his sister. He is much attached to her, no doubt,and would lead a lonely life without her, but it would seem theheight of selfishness if he were to stand in the way of hermaking so brilliant a marriage. Yet I am certain that he does notwish their intimacy to ripen into love, and I have several timesobserved that he has taken pains to prevent them from being_tete-a-tete_. By the way, your instructions to me never to allowSir Henry to go out alone will become very much more onerous if alove affair were to be added to our other difficulties. Mypopularity would soon suffer if I were to carry out your ordersto the letter.The other day-Thursday, to be more exact-Dr. Mortimer lunchedwith us. He has been excavating a barrow at Long Down and has gota prehistoric skull which fills him with great joy. Never wasthere such a single-minded enthusiast as he! The Stapletons camein afterwards, and the good doctor took us all to the yew alleyat Sir Henry's request to show us exactly how everything occurredupon that fatal night. It is a long, dismal walk, the yew alley,between two high walls of clipped hedge, with a narrow band ofgrass upon either side. At the far end is an old tumble-downsummer-house. Halfway down is the moor-gate, where the oldgentleman left his cigar-ash. It is a white wooden gate with alatch. Beyond it lies the wide moor. I remembered your theory ofthe affair and tried to picture all that had occurred. As the oldman stood there he saw something coming across the moor,something which terrified him so that he lost his wits and ranand ran until he died of sheer horror and exhaustion. There wasthe long, gloomy tunnel down which he fled. And from what? Asheep-dog of the moor? Or a spectral hound, black, silent, andmonstrous? Was there a human agency in the matter? Did the pale,watchful Barrymore know more than he cared to say? It was all dimand vague, but always there is the dark shadow of crime behindit.One other neighbour I have met since I wrote last. This is Mr.Frankland, of Lafter Hall, who lives some four miles to the southof us. He is an elderly man, red-faced, white-haired, andcholeric. His passion is for the British law, and he has spent alarge fortune in litigation. He fights for the mere pleasure offighting and is equally ready to take up either side of aquestion, so that it is no wonder that he has found it a costlyamusement. Sometimes he will shut up a right of way and defy theparish to make him open it. At others he will with his own handstear down some other man's gate and declare that a path hasexisted there from time immemorial, defying the owner toprosecute him for trespass. He is learned in old manorial andcommunal rights, and he applies his knowledge sometimes in favourof the villagers of Fernworthy and sometimes against them, sothat he is periodically either carried in triumph down thevillage street or else burned in effigy, according to his latestexploit. He is said to have about seven lawsuits upon his handsat present, which will probably swallow up the remainder of hisfortune and so draw his sting and leave him harmless for thefuture. Apart from the law he seems a kindly, good-naturedperson, and I only mention him because you were particular that Ishould send some description of the people who surround us. He iscuriously employed at present, for, being an amateur astronomer,he has an excellent telescope, with which he lies upon the roofof his own house and sweeps the moor all day in the hope ofcatching a glimpse of the escaped convict. If he would confinehis energies to this all would be well, but there are rumoursthat he intends to prosecute Dr. Mortimer for opening a gravewithout the consent of the next of kin because he dug up theNeolithic skull in the barrow on Long Down. He helps to keep ourlives from being monotonous and gives a little comic relief whereit is badly needed.And now, having brought you up to date in the escaped convict,the Stapletons, Dr. Mortimer, and Frankland, of Lafter Hall, letme end on that which is most important and tell you more aboutthe Barrymores, and especially about the surprising developmentof last night.First of all about the test telegram, which you sent from Londonin order to make sure that Barrymore was really here. I havealready explained that the testimony of the postmaster shows thatthe test was worthless and that we have no proof one way or theother. I told Sir Henry how the matter stood, and he at once, inhis downright fashion, had Barrymore up and asked him whether hehad received the telegram himself. Barrymore said that he had."Did the boy deliver it into your own hands?" asked Sir Henry.Barrymore looked surprised, and considered for a little time."No," said he, "I was in the box-room at the time, and my wifebrought it up to me.""Did you answer it yourself?""No; I told my wife what to answer and she went down to writeit."In the evening he recurred to the subject of his own accord."I could not quite understand the object of your questions thismorning, Sir Henry," said he. "I trust that they do not mean thatI have done anything to forfeit your confidence?"Sir Henry had to assure him that it was not so and pacify him bygiving him a considerable part of his old wardrobe, the Londonoutfit having now all arrived.Mrs. Barrymore is of interest to me. She is a heavy, solidperson, very limited, intensely respectable, and inclined to bepuritanical. You could hardly conceive a less emotional subject.Yet I have told you how, on the first night here, I heard hersobbing bitterly, and since then I have more than once observedtraces of tears upon her face. Some deep sorrow gnaws ever at herheart. Sometimes I wonder if she has a guilty memory which hauntsher, and sometimes I suspect Barrymore of being a domestictyrant. I have always felt that there was something singular andquestionable in this man's character, but the adventure of lastnight brings all my suspicions to a head.And yet it may seem a small matter in itself. You are aware thatI am not a very sound sleeper, and since I have been on guard inthis house my slumbers have been lighter than ever. Last night,about two in the morning, I was aroused by a stealthy steppassing my room. I rose, opened my door, and peeped out. A longblack shadow was trailing down the corridor. It was thrown by aman who walked softly down the passage with a candle held in hishand. He was in shirt and trousers, with no covering to his feet.I could merely see the outline, but his height told me that itwas Barrymore. He walked very slowly and circumspectly, and therewas something indescribably guilty and furtive in his wholeappearance.I have told you that the corridor is broken by the balcony whichruns round the hall, but that it is resumed upon the fartherside. I waited until he had passed out of sight and then Ifollowed him. When I came round the balcony he had reached theend of the farther corridor, and I could see from the glimmer oflight through an open door that he had entered one of the rooms.Now, all these rooms are unfurnished and unoccupied so that hisexpedition became more mysterious than ever. The light shonesteadily as if he were standing motionless. I crept down thepassage as noiselessly as I could and peeped round the corner ofthe door.Barrymore was crouching at the window with the candle heldagainst the glass. His profile was half turned towards me, andhis face seemed to be rigid with expectation as he stared outinto the blackness of the moor. For some minutes he stoodwatching intently. Then he gave a deep groan and with animpatient gesture he put out the light. Instantly I made my wayback to my room, and very shortly came the stealthy steps passingonce more upon their return journey. Long afterwards when I hadfallen into a light sleep I heard a key turn somewhere in a lock,but I could not tell whence the sound came. What it all means Icannot guess, but there is some secret business going on in thishouse of gloom which sooner or later we shall get to the bottomof. I do not trouble you with my theories, for you asked me tofurnish you only with facts. I have had a long talk with SirHenry this morning, and we have made a plan of campaign foundedupon my observations of last night. I will not speak about itjust now, but it should make my next report interesting reading.Chapter 9.The Light upon the Moor [Second Report of Dr. Watson]Baskerville Hall, Oct. 15th.MY DEAR HOLMES,If I was compelled to leave you without much news during theearly days of my mission you must acknowledge that I am making upfor lost time, and that events are now crowding thick and fastupon us. In my last report I ended upon my top note withBarrymore at the window, and now I have quite a budget alreadywhich will, unless I am much mistaken, considerably surprise you.Things have taken a turn which I could not have anticipated. Insome ways they have within the last forty-eight hours become muchclearer and in some ways they have become more complicated. But Iwill tell you all and you shall judge for yourself.Before breakfast on the morning following my adventure I wentdown the corridor and examined the room in which Barrymore hadbeen on the night before. The western window through which he hadstared so intently has, I noticed, one peculiarity above allother windows in the house-it commands the nearest outlook on tothe moor. There is an opening between two trees which enables onefrom this point of view to look right down upon it, while fromall the other windows it is only a distant glimpse which can beobtained. It follows, therefore, that Barrymore, since only thiswindow would serve the purpose, must have been looking out forsomething or somebody upon the moor. The night was very dark, sothat I can hardly imagine how he could have hoped to see anyone.It had struck me that it was possible that some love intrigue wason foot. That would have accounted for his stealthy movements andalso for the uneasiness of his wife. The man is astriking-looking fellow, very well equipped to steal the heart ofa country girl, so that this theory seemed to have something tosupport it. That opening of the door which I had heard after Ihad returned to my room might mean that he had gone out to keepsome clandestine appointment. So I reasoned with myself in themorning, and I tell you the direction of my suspicions, howevermuch the result may have shown that they were unfounded.But whatever the true explanation of Barrymore's movements mightbe, I felt that the responsibility of keeping them to myselfuntil I could explain them was more than I could bear. I had aninterview with the baronet in his study after breakfast, and Itold him all that I had seen. He was less surprised than I hadexpected."I knew that Barrymore walked about nights, and I had a mind tospeak to him about it," said he. "Two or three times I have heardhis steps in the passage, coming and going, just about the houryou name.""Perhaps then he pays a visit every night to that particularwindow," I suggested."Perhaps he does. If so, we should be able to shadow him and seewhat it is that he is after. I wonder what your friend Holmeswould do if he were here.""I believe that he would do exactly what you now suggest," saidI. "He would follow Barrymore and see what he did.""Then we shall do it together.""But surely he would hear us.""The man is rather deaf, and in any case we must take our chanceof that. We'll sit up in my room tonight and wait until hepasses." Sir Henry rubbed his hands with pleasure, and it wasevident that he hailed the adventure as a relief to his somewhatquiet life upon the moor.The baronet has been in communication with the architect whoprepared the plans for Sir Charles, and with a contractor fromLondon, so that we may expect great changes to begin here soon.There have been decorators and furnishers up from Plymouth, andit is evident that our friend has large ideas and means to spareno pains or expense to restore the grandeur of his family. Whenthe house is renovated and refurnished, all that he will needwill be a wife to make it complete. Between ourselves there arepretty clear signs that this will not be wanting if the lady iswilling, for I have seldom seen a man more infatuated with awoman than he is with our beautiful neighbour, Miss Stapleton.And yet the course of true love does not run quite as smoothly asone would under the circumstances expect. Today, for example, itssurface was broken by a very unexpected ripple, which has causedour friend considerable perplexity and annoyance.After the conversation which I have quoted about Barrymore, SirHenry put on his hat and prepared to go out. As a matter ofcourse I did the same."What, are _you_ coming, Watson?" he asked, looking at me in acurious way."That depends on whether you are going on the moor," said I."Yes, I am.""Well, you know what my instructions are. I am sorry to intrude,but you heard how earnestly Holmes insisted that I should notleave you, and especially that you should not go alone upon themoor."Sir Henry put his hand upon my shoulder with a pleasant smile."My dear fellow," said he, "Holmes, with all his wisdom, did notforesee some things which have happened since I have been on themoor. You understand me? I am sure that you are the last man inthe world who would wish to be a spoil-sport. I must go outalone."It put me in a most awkward position. I was at a loss what to sayor what to do, and before I had made up my mind he picked up hiscane and was gone.But when I came to think the matter over my conscience reproachedme bitterly for having on any pretext allowed him to go out of mysight. I imagined what my feelings would be if I had to return toyou and to confess that some misfortune had occurred through mydisregard for your instructions. I assure you my cheeks flushedat the very thought. It might not even now be too late toovertake him, so I set off at once in the direction of MerripitHouse.I hurried along the road at the top of my speed without seeinganything of Sir Henry, until I came to the point where the moorpath branches off. There, fearing that perhaps I had come in thewrong direction after all, I mounted a hill from which I couldcommand a view-the same hill which is cut into the dark quarry.Thence I saw him at once. He was on the moor path about a quarterof a mile off, and a lady was by his side who could only be MissStapleton. It was clear that there was already an understandingbetween them and that they had met by appointment. They werewalking slowly along in deep conversation, and I saw her makingquick little movements of her hands as if she were very earnestin what she was saying, while he listened intently, and once ortwice shook his head in strong dissent. I stood among the rockswatching them, very much puzzled as to what I should do next. Tofollow them and break into their intimate conversation seemed tobe an outrage, and yet my clear duty was never for an instant tolet him out of my sight. To act the spy upon a friend was ahateful task. Still, I could see no better course than to observehim from the hill, and to clear my conscience by confessing tohim afterwards what I had done. It is true that if any suddendanger had threatened him I was too far away to be of use, andyet I am sure that you will agree with me that the position wasvery difficult, and that there was nothing more which I could do.Our friend, Sir Henry, and the lady had halted on the path andwere standing deeply absorbed in their conversation, when I wassuddenly aware that I was not the only witness of theirinterview. A wisp of green floating in the air caught my eye, andanother glance showed me that it was carried on a stick by a manwho was moving among the broken ground. It was Stapleton with hisbutterfly-net. He was very much closer to the pair than I was,and he appeared to be moving in their direction. At this instantSir Henry suddenly drew Miss Stapleton to his side. His arm wasround her, but it seemed to me that she was straining away fromhim with her face averted. He stooped his head to hers, and sheraised one hand as if in protest. Next moment I saw them springapart and turn hurriedly round. Stapleton was the cause of theinterruption. He was running wildly towards them, his absurd netdangling behind him. He gesticulated and almost danced withexcitement in front of the lovers. What the scene meant I couldnot imagine, but it seemed to me that Stapleton was abusing SirHenry, who offered explanations, which became more angry as theother refused to accept them. The lady stood by in haughtysilence. Finally Stapleton turned upon his heel and beckoned in aperemptory way to his sister, who, after an irresolute glance atSir Henry, walked off by the side of her brother. Thenaturalist's angry gestures showed that the lady was included inhis displeasure. The baronet stood for a minute looking afterthem, and then he walked slowly back the way that he had come,his head hanging, the very picture of dejection.What all this meant I could not imagine, but I was deeply ashamedto have witnessed so intimate a scene without my friend'sknowledge. I ran down the hill therefore and met the baronet atthe bottom. His face was flushed with anger and his brows werewrinkled, like one who is at his wit's ends what to do."Halloa, Watson! Where have you dropped from?" said he. "Youdon't mean to say that you came after me in spite of all?"I explained everything to him: how I had found it impossible toremain behind, how I had followed him, and how I had witnessedall that had occurred. For an instant his eyes blazed at me, butmy frankness disarmed his anger, and he broke at last into arather rueful laugh."You would have thought the middle of that prairie a fairly safeplace for a man to be private," said he, "but, by thunder, thewhole countryside seems to have been out to see me do mywooing-and a mighty poor wooing at that! Where had you engaged aseat?""I was on that hill.""Quite in the back row, eh? But her brother was well up to thefront. Did you see him come out on us?""Yes, I did.""Did he ever strike you as being crazy-this brother of hers?""I can't say that he ever did.""I dare say not. I always thought him sane enough until today,but you can take it from me that either he or I ought to be in astraitjacket. What's the matter with me, anyhow? You've livednear me for some weeks, Watson. Tell me straight, now! Is thereanything that would prevent me from making a good husband to awoman that I loved?""I should say not.""He can't object to my worldly position, so it must be myselfthat he has this down on. What has he against me? I never hurtman or woman in my life that I know of. And yet he would not somuch as let me touch the tips of her fingers.""Did he say so?""That, and a deal more. I tell you, Watson, I've only known herthese few weeks, but from the first I just felt that she was madefor me, and she, too-she was happy when she was with me, and thatI'll swear. There's a light in a woman's eyes that speaks louderthan words. But he has never let us get together and it was onlytoday for the first time that I saw a chance of having a fewwords with her alone. She was glad to meet me, but when she didit was not love that she would talk about, and she wouldn't havelet me talk about it either if she could have stopped it. Shekept coming back to it that this was a place of danger, and thatshe would never be happy until I had left it. I told her thatsince I had seen her I was in no hurry to leave it, and that ifshe really wanted me to go, the only way to work it was for herto arrange to go with me. With that I offered in as many words tomarry her, but before she could answer, down came this brother ofhers, running at us with a face on him like a madman. He was justwhite with rage, and those light eyes of his were blazing withfury. What was I doing with the lady? How dared I offer herattentions which were distasteful to her? Did I think thatbecause I was a baronet I could do what I liked? If he had notbeen her brother I should have known better how to answer him. Asit was I told him that my feelings towards his sister were suchas I was not ashamed of, and that I hoped that she might honourme by becoming my wife. That seemed to make the matter no better,so then I lost my temper too, and I answered him rather morehotly than I should perhaps, considering that she was standingby. So it ended by his going off with her, as you saw, and heream I as badly puzzled a man as any in this county. Just tell mewhat it all means, Watson, and I'll owe you more than ever I canhope to pay."I tried one or two explanations, but, indeed, I was completelypuzzled myself. Our friend's title, his fortune, his age, hischaracter, and his appearance are all in his favour, and I knownothing against him unless it be this dark fate which runs in hisfamily. That his advances should be rejected so brusquely withoutany reference to the lady's own wishes and that the lady shouldaccept the situation without protest is very amazing. However,our conjectures were set at rest by a visit from Stapletonhimself that very afternoon. He had come to offer apologies forhis rudeness of the morning, and after a long private interviewwith Sir Henry in his study the upshot of their conversation wasthat the breach is quite healed, and that we are to dine atMerripit House next Friday as a sign of it."I don't say now that he isn't a crazy man," said Sir Henry; "Ican't forget the look in his eyes when he ran at me this morning,but I must allow that no man could make a more handsome apologythan he has done.""Did he give any explanation of his conduct?""His sister is everything in his life, he says. That is naturalenough, and I am glad that he should understand her value. Theyhave always been together, and according to his account he hasbeen a very lonely man with only her as a companion, so that thethought of losing her was really terrible to him. He had notunderstood, he said, that I was becoming attached to her, butwhen he saw with his own eyes that it was really so, and that shemight be taken away from him, it gave him such a shock that for atime he was not responsible for what he said or did. He was verysorry for all that had passed, and he recognized how foolish andhow selfish it was that he should imagine that he could hold abeautiful woman like his sister to himself for her whole life. Ifshe had to leave him he had rather it was to a neighbour likemyself than to anyone else. But in any case it was a blow to himand it would take him some time before he could prepare himselfto meet it. He would withdraw all opposition upon his part if Iwould promise for three months to let the matter rest and to becontent with cultivating the lady's friendship during that timewithout claiming her love. This I promised, and so the matterrests."So there is one of our small mysteries cleared up. It issomething to have touched bottom anywhere in this bog in which weare floundering. We know now why Stapleton looked with disfavourupon his sister's suitor-even when that suitor was so eligible aone as Sir Henry. And now I pass on to another thread which Ihave extricated out of the tangled skein, the mystery of the sobsin the night, of the tear-stained face of Mrs. Barrymore, of thesecret journey of the butler to the western lattice window.Congratulate me, my dear Holmes, and tell me that I have notdisappointed you as an agent-that you do not regret theconfidence which you showed in me when you sent me down. Allthese things have by one night's work been thoroughly cleared.I have said "by one night's work," but, in truth, it was by twonights' work, for on the first we drew entirely blank. I sat upwith Sir Henry in his rooms until nearly three o'clock in themorning, but no sound of any sort did we hear except the chimingclock upon the stairs. It was a most melancholy vigil and endedby each of us falling asleep in our chairs. Fortunately we werenot discouraged, and we determined to try again. The next nightwe lowered the lamp and sat smoking cigarettes without making theleast sound. It was incredible how slowly the hours crawled by,and yet we were helped through it by the same sort of patientinterest which the hunter must feel as he watches the trap intowhich he hopes the game may wander. One struck, and two, and wehad almost for the second time given it up in despair when in aninstant we both sat bolt upright in our chairs with all our wearysenses keenly on the alert once more. We had heard the creak of astep in the passage.Very stealthily we heard it pass along until it died away in thedistance. Then the baronet gently opened his door and we set outin pursuit. Already our man had gone round the gallery and thecorridor was all in darkness. Softly we stole along until we hadcome into the other wing. We were just in time to catch a glimpseof the tall, black-bearded figure, his shoulders rounded as hetiptoed down the passage. Then he passed through the same door asbefore, and the light of the candle framed it in the darkness andshot one single yellow beam across the gloom of the corridor. Weshuffled cautiously towards it, trying every plank before wedared to put our whole weight upon it. We had taken theprecaution of leaving our boots behind us, but, even so, the oldboards snapped and creaked beneath our tread. Sometimes it seemedimpossible that he should fail to hear our approach. However, theman is fortunately rather deaf, and he was entirely preoccupiedin that which he was doing. When at last we reached the door andpeeped through we found him crouching at the window, candle inhand, his white, intent face pressed against the pane, exactly asI had seen him two nights before.We had arranged no plan of campaign, but the baronet is a man towhom the most direct way is always the most natural. He walkedinto the room, and as he did so Barrymore sprang up from thewindow with a sharp hiss of his breath and stood, livid andtrembling, before us. His dark eyes, glaring out of the whitemask of his face, were full of horror and astonishment as hegazed from Sir Henry to me."What are you doing here, Barrymore?""Nothing, sir." His agitation was so great that he could hardlyspeak, and the shadows sprang up and down from the shaking of hiscandle. "It was the window, sir. I go round at night to see thatthey are fastened.""On the second floor?""Yes, sir, all the windows.""Look here, Barrymore," said Sir Henry sternly, "we have made upour minds to have the truth out of you, so it will save youtrouble to tell it sooner rather than later. Come, now! No lies!What were you doing at that window?"The fellow looked at us in a helpless way, and he wrung his handstogether like one who is in the last extremity of doubt andmisery."I was doing no harm, sir. I was holding a candle to the window.""And why were you holding a candle to the window?""Don't ask me, Sir Henry-don't ask me! I give you my word, sir,that it is not my secret, and that I cannot tell it. If itconcerned no one but myself I would not try to keep it from you."A sudden idea occurred to me, and I took the candle from thetrembling hand of the butler."He must have been holding it as a signal," said I. "Let us seeif there is any answer." I held it as he had done, and stared outinto the darkness of the night. Vaguely I could discern the blackbank of the trees and the lighter expanse of the moor, for themoon was behind the clouds. And then I gave a cry of exultation,for a tiny pinpoint of yellow light had suddenly transfixed thedark veil, and glowed steadily in the centre of the black squareframed by the window."There it is!" I cried."No, no, sir, it is nothing-nothing at all!" the butler broke in;"I assure you, sir-""Move your light across the window, Watson!" cried the baronet."See, the other moves also! Now, you rascal, do you deny that itis a signal? Come, speak up! Who is your confederate out yonder,and what is this conspiracy that is going on?"The man's face became openly defiant. "It is my business, and notyours. I will not tell.""Then you leave my employment right away.""Very good, sir. If I must I must.""And you go in disgrace. By thunder, you may well be ashamed ofyourself. Your family has lived with mine for over a hundredyears under this roof, and here I find you deep in some dark plotagainst me.""No, no, sir; no, not against you!" It was a woman's voice, andMrs. Barrymore, paler and more horror-struck than her husband,was standing at the door. Her bulky figure in a shawl and skirtmight have been comic were it not for the intensity of feelingupon her face."We have to go, Eliza. This is the end of it. You can pack ourthings," said the butler."Oh, John, John, have I brought you to this? It is my doing, SirHenry-all mine. He has done nothing except for my sake andbecause I asked him.""Speak out, then! What does it mean?""My unhappy brother is starving on the moor. We cannot let himperish at our very gates. The light is a signal to him that foodis ready for him, and his light out yonder is to show the spot towhich to bring it.""Then your brother is-""The escaped convict, sir-Selden, the criminal.""That's the truth, sir," said Barrymore. "I said that it was notmy secret and that I could not tell it to you. But now you haveheard it, and you will see that if there was a plot it was notagainst you."This, then, was the explanation of the stealthy expeditions atnight and the light at the window. Sir Henry and I both stared atthe woman in amazement. Was it possible that this stolidlyrespectable person was of the same blood as one of the mostnotorious criminals in the country?"Yes, sir, my name was Selden, and he is my younger brother. Wehumoured him too much when he was a lad and gave him his own wayin everything until he came to think that the world was made forhis pleasure, and that he could do what he liked in it. Then ashe grew older he met wicked companions, and the devil enteredinto him until he broke my mother's heart and dragged our name inthe dirt. From crime to crime he sank lower and lower until it isonly the mercy of God which has snatched him from the scaffold;but to me, sir, he was always the little curly-headed boy that Ihad nursed and played with as an elder sister would. That was whyhe broke prison, sir. He knew that I was here and that we couldnot refuse to help him. When he dragged himself here one night,weary and starving, with the warders hard at his heels, whatcould we do? We took him in and fed him and cared for him. Thenyou returned, sir, and my brother thought he would be safer onthe moor than anywhere else until the hue and cry was over, so helay in hiding there. But every second night we made sure if hewas still there by putting a light in the window, and if therewas an answer my husband took out some bread and meat to him.Every day we hoped that he was gone, but as long as he was therewe could not desert him. That is the whole truth, as I am anhonest Christian woman and you will see that if there is blame inthe matter it does not lie with my husband but with me, for whosesake he has done all that he has."The woman's words came with an intense earnestness which carriedconviction with them."Is this true, Barrymore?""Yes, Sir Henry. Every word of it.""Well, I cannot blame you for standing by your own wife. Forgetwhat I have said. Go to your room, you two, and we shall talkfurther about this matter in the morning."When they were gone we looked out of the window again. Sir Henryhad flung it open, and the cold night wind beat in upon ourfaces. Far away in the black distance there still glowed that onetiny point of yellow light."I wonder he dares," said Sir Henry."It may be so placed as to be only visible from here.""Very likely. How far do you think it is?""Out by the Cleft Tor, I think.""Not more than a mile or two off.""Hardly that.""Well, it cannot be far if Barrymore had to carry out the food toit. And he is waiting, this villain, beside that candle. Bythunder, Watson, I am going out to take that man!"The same thought had crossed my own mind. It was not as if theBarrymores had taken us into their confidence. Their secret hadbeen forced from them. The man was a danger to the community, anunmitigated scoundrel for whom there was neither pity nor excuse.We were only doing our duty in taking this chance of putting himback where he could do no harm. With his brutal and violentnature, others would have to pay the price if we held our hands.Any night, for example, our neighbours the Stapletons might beattacked by him, and it may have been the thought of this whichmade Sir Henry so keen upon the adventure."I will come," said I."Then get your revolver and put on your boots. The sooner westart the better, as the fellow may put out his light and beoff."In five minutes we were outside the door, starting upon ourexpedition. We hurried through the dark shrubbery, amid the dullmoaning of the autumn wind and the rustle of the falling leaves.The night air was heavy with the smell of damp and decay. Now andagain the moon peeped out for an instant, but clouds were drivingover the face of the sky, and just as we came out on the moor athin rain began to fall. The light still burned steadily infront."Are you armed?" I asked."I have a hunting-crop.""We must close in on him rapidly, for he is said to be adesperate fellow. We shall take him by surprise and have him atour mercy before he can resist.""I say, Watson," said the baronet, "what would Holmes say tothis? How about that hour of darkness in which the power of evilis exalted?"As if in answer to his words there rose suddenly out of the vastgloom of the moor that strange cry which I had already heard uponthe borders of the great Grimpen Mire. It came with the windthrough the silence of the night, a long, deep mutter, then arising howl, and then the sad moan in which it died away. Againand again it sounded, the whole air throbbing with it, strident,wild, and menacing. The baronet caught my sleeve and his faceglimmered white through the darkness."My God, what's that, Watson?""I don't know. It's a sound they have on the moor. I heard itonce before."It died away, and an absolute silence closed in upon us. We stoodstraining our ears, but nothing came."Watson," said the baronet, "it was the cry of a hound."My blood ran cold in my veins, for there was a break in his voicewhich told of the sudden horror which had seized him."What do they call this sound?" he asked."Who?""The folk on the countryside.""Oh, they are ignorant people. Why should you mind what they callit?""Tell me, Watson. What do they say of it?"I hesitated but could not escape the question."They say it is the cry of the Hound of the Baskervilles."He groaned and was silent for a few moments."A hound it was," he said at last, "but it seemed to come frommiles away, over yonder, I think.""It was hard to say whence it came.""It rose and fell with the wind. Isn't that the direction of thegreat Grimpen Mire?""Yes, it is.""Well, it was up there. Come now, Watson, didn't you thinkyourself that it was the cry of a hound? I am not a child. Youneed not fear to speak the truth.""Stapleton was with me when I heard it last. He said that itmight be the calling of a strange bird.""No, no, it was a hound. My God, can there be some truth in allthese stories? Is it possible that I am really in danger from sodark a cause? You don't believe it, do you, Watson?""No, no.""And yet it was one thing to laugh about it in London, and it isanother to stand out here in the darkness of the moor and to hearsuch a cry as that. And my uncle! There was the footprint of thehound beside him as he lay. It all fits together. I don't thinkthat I am a coward, Watson, but that sound seemed to freeze myvery blood. Feel my hand!"It was as cold as a block of marble."You'll be all right tomorrow.""I don't think I'll get that cry out of my head. What do youadvise that we do now?""Shall we turn back?""No, by thunder; we have come out to get our man, and we will doit. We after the convict, and a hell-hound, as likely as not,after us. Come on! We'll see it through if all the fiends of thepit were loose upon the moor."We stumbled slowly along in the darkness, with the black loom ofthe craggy hills around us, and the yellow speck of light burningsteadily in front. There is nothing so deceptive as the distanceof a light upon a pitch-dark night, and sometimes the glimmerseemed to be far away upon the horizon and sometimes it mighthave been within a few yards of us. But at last we could seewhence it came, and then we knew that we were indeed very close.A guttering candle was stuck in a crevice of the rocks whichflanked it on each side so as to keep the wind from it and alsoto prevent it from being visible, save in the direction ofBaskerville Hall. A boulder of granite concealed our approach,and crouching behind it we gazed over it at the signal light. Itwas strange to see this single candle burning there in the middleof the moor, with no sign of life near it-just the one straightyellow flame and the gleam of the rock on each side of it."What shall we do now?" whispered Sir Henry."Wait here. He must be near his light. Let us see if we can get aglimpse of him."The words were hardly out of my mouth when we both saw him. Overthe rocks, in the crevice of which the candle burned, there wasthrust out an evil yellow face, a terrible animal face, allseamed and scored with vile passions. Foul with mire, with abristling beard, and hung with matted hair, it might well havebelonged to one of those old savages who dwelt in the burrows onthe hillsides. The light beneath him was reflected in his small,cunning eyes which peered fiercely to right and left through thedarkness like a crafty and savage animal who has heard the stepsof the hunters.Something had evidently aroused his suspicions. It may have beenthat Barrymore had some private signal which we had neglected togive, or the fellow may have had some other reason for thinkingthat all was not well, but I could read his fears upon his wickedface. Any instant he might dash out the light and vanish in thedarkness. I sprang forward therefore, and Sir Henry did the same.At the same moment the convict screamed out a curse at us andhurled a rock which splintered up against the boulder which hadsheltered us. I caught one glimpse of his short, squat, stronglybuilt figure as he sprang to his feet and turned to run. At thesame moment by a lucky chance the moon broke through the clouds.We rushed over the brow of the hill, and there was our manrunning with great speed down the other side, springing over thestones in his way with the activity of a mountain goat. A luckylong shot of my revolver might have crippled him, but I hadbrought it only to defend myself if attacked and not to shoot anunarmed man who was running away.We were both swift runners and in fairly good training, but wesoon found that we had no chance of overtaking him. We saw himfor a long time in the moonlight until he was only a small speckmoving swiftly among the boulders upon the side of a distanthill. We ran and ran until we were completely blown, but thespace between us grew ever wider. Finally we stopped and satpanting on two rocks, while we watched him disappearing in thedistance.And it was at this moment that there occurred a most strange andunexpected thing. We had risen from our rocks and were turning togo home, having abandoned the hopeless chase. The moon was lowupon the right, and the jagged pinnacle of a granite tor stood upagainst the lower curve of its silver disc. There, outlined asblack as an ebony statue on that shining background, I saw thefigure of a man upon the tor. Do not think that it was adelusion, Holmes. I assure you that I have never in my life seenanything more clearly. As far as I could judge, the figure wasthat of a tall, thin man. He stood with his legs a littleseparated, his arms folded, his head bowed, as if he werebrooding over that enormous wilderness of peat and granite whichlay before him. He might have been the very spirit of thatterrible place. It was not the convict. This man was far from theplace where the latter had disappeared. Besides, he was a muchtaller man. With a cry of surprise I pointed him out to thebaronet, but in the instant during which I had turned to grasphis arm the man was gone. There was the sharp pinnacle of granitestill cutting the lower edge of the moon, but its peak bore notrace of that silent and motionless figure.I wished to go in that direction and to search the tor, but itwas some distance away. The baronet's nerves were still quiveringfrom that cry, which recalled the dark story of his family, andhe was not in the mood for fresh adventures. He had not seen thislonely man upon the tor and could not feel the thrill which hisstrange presence and his commanding attitude had given to me. "Awarder, no doubt," said he. "The moor has been thick with themsince this fellow escaped." Well, perhaps his explanation may bethe right one, but I should like to have some further proof ofit. Today we mean to communicate to the Princetown people wherethey should look for their missing man, but it is hard lines thatwe have not actually had the triumph of bringing him back as ourown prisoner. Such are the adventures of last night, and you mustacknowledge, my dear Holmes, that I have done you very well inthe matter of a report. Much of what I tell you is no doubt quiteirrelevant, but still I feel that it is best that I should letyou have all the facts and leave you to select for yourself thosewhich will be of most service to you in helping you to yourconclusions. We are certainly making some progress. So far as theBarrymores go we have found the motive of their actions, and thathas cleared up the situation very much. But the moor with itsmysteries and its strange inhabitants remains as inscrutable asever. Perhaps in my next I may be able to throw some light uponthis also. Best of all would it be if you could come down to us.In any case you will hear from me again in the course of the nextfew days.Chapter 10.Extract from the Diary of Dr. WatsonSo far I have been able to quote from the reports which I haveforwarded during these early days to Sherlock Holmes. Now,however, I have arrived at a point in my narrative where I amcompelled to abandon this method and to trust once more to myrecollections, aided by the diary which I kept at the time. A fewextracts from the latter will carry me on to those scenes whichare indelibly fixed in every detail upon my memory. I proceed,then, from the morning which followed our abortive chase of theconvict and our other strange experiences upon the moor._October_ 16_th_.-A dull and foggy day with a drizzle of rain.The house is banked in with rolling clouds, which rise now andthen to show the dreary curves of the moor, with thin, silverveins upon the sides of the hills, and the distant bouldersgleaming where the light strikes upon their wet faces. It ismelancholy outside and in. The baronet is in a black reactionafter the excitements of the night. I am conscious myself of aweight at my heart and a feeling of impending danger-ever presentdanger, which is the more terrible because I am unable to defineit.And have I not cause for such a feeling? Consider the longsequence of incidents which have all pointed to some sinisterinfluence which is at work around us. There is the death of thelast occupant of the Hall, fulfilling so exactly the conditionsof the family legend, and there are the repeated reports frompeasants of the appearance of a strange creature upon the moor.Twice I have with my own ears heard the sound which resembled thedistant baying of a hound. It is incredible, impossible, that itshould really be outside the ordinary laws of nature. A spectralhound which leaves material footmarks and fills the air with itshowling is surely not to be thought of. Stapleton may fall inwith such a superstition, and Mortimer also, but if I have onequality upon earth it is common sense, and nothing will persuademe to believe in such a thing. To do so would be to descend tothe level of these poor peasants, who are not content with a merefiend dog but must needs describe him with hell-fire shootingfrom his mouth and eyes. Holmes would not listen to such fancies,and I am his agent. But facts are facts, and I have twice heardthis crying upon the moor. Suppose that there were really somehuge hound loose upon it; that would go far to explaineverything. But where could such a hound lie concealed, where didit get its food, where did it come from, how was it that no onesaw it by day? It must be confessed that the natural explanationoffers almost as many difficulties as the other. And always,apart from the hound, there is the fact of the human agency inLondon, the man in the cab, and the letter which warned Sir Henryagainst the moor. This at least was real, but it might have beenthe work of a protecting friend as easily as of an enemy. Whereis that friend or enemy now? Has he remained in London, or has hefollowed us down here? Could he-could he be the stranger whom Isaw upon the tor?It is true that I have had only the one glance at him, and yetthere are some things to which I am ready to swear. He is no onewhom I have seen down here, and I have now met all theneighbours. The figure was far taller than that of Stapleton, farthinner than that of Frankland. Barrymore it might possibly havebeen, but we had left him behind us, and I am certain that hecould not have followed us. A stranger then is still dogging us,just as a stranger dogged us in London. We have never shaken himoff. If I could lay my hands upon that man, then at last we mightfind ourselves at the end of all our difficulties. To this onepurpose I must now devote all my energies.My first impulse was to tell Sir Henry all my plans. My secondand wisest one is to play my own game and speak as little aspossible to anyone. He is silent and distrait. His nerves havebeen strangely shaken by that sound upon the moor. I will saynothing to add to his anxieties, but I will take my own steps toattain my own end.We had a small scene this morning after breakfast. Barrymoreasked leave to speak with Sir Henry, and they were closeted inhis study some little time. Sitting in the billiard-room I morethan once heard the sound of voices raised, and I had a prettygood idea what the point was which was under discussion. After atime the baronet opened his door and called for me. "Barrymoreconsiders that he has a grievance," he said. "He thinks that itwas unfair on our part to hunt his brother-in-law down when he,of his own free will, had told us the secret."The butler was standing very pale but very collected before us."I may have spoken too warmly, sir," said he, "and if I have, Iam sure that I beg your pardon. At the same time, I was very muchsurprised when I heard you two gentlemen come back this morningand learned that you had been chasing Selden. The poor fellow hasenough to fight against without my putting more upon his track.""If you had told us of your own free will it would have been adifferent thing," said the baronet, "you only told us, or ratheryour wife only told us, when it was forced from you and you couldnot help yourself.""I didn't think you would have taken advantage of it, SirHenry-indeed I didn't.""The man is a public danger. There are lonely houses scatteredover the moor, and he is a fellow who would stick at nothing. Youonly want to get a glimpse of his face to see that. Look at Mr.Stapleton's house, for example, with no one but himself to defendit. There's no safety for anyone until he is under lock and key.""He'll break into no house, sir. I give you my solemn word uponthat. But he will never trouble anyone in this country again. Iassure you, Sir Henry, that in a very few days the necessaryarrangements will have been made and he will be on his way toSouth America. For God's sake, sir, I beg of you not to let thepolice know that he is still on the moor. They have given up thechase there, and he can lie quiet until the ship is ready forhim. You can't tell on him without getting my wife and me intotrouble. I beg you, sir, to say nothing to the police.""What do you say, Watson?"I shrugged my shoulders. "If he were safely out of the country itwould relieve the tax-payer of a burden.""But how about the chance of his holding someone up before hegoes?""He would not do anything so mad, sir. We have provided him withall that he can want. To commit a crime would be to show where hewas hiding.""That is true," said Sir Henry. "Well, Barrymore-""God bless you, sir, and thank you from my heart! It would havekilled my poor wife had he been taken again.""I guess we are aiding and abetting a felony, Watson? But, afterwhat we have heard I don't feel as if I could give the man up, sothere is an end of it. All right, Barrymore, you can go."With a few broken words of gratitude the man turned, but hehesitated and then came back."You've been so kind to us, sir, that I should like to do thebest I can for you in return. I know something, Sir Henry, andperhaps I should have said it before, but it was long after theinquest that I found it out. I've never breathed a word about ityet to mortal man. It's about poor Sir Charles's death."The baronet and I were both upon our feet. "Do you know how hedied?""No, sir, I don't know that.""What then?""I know why he was at the gate at that hour. It was to meet awoman.""To meet a woman! He?""Yes, sir.""And the woman's name?""I can't give you the name, sir, but I can give you the initials.Her initials were L. L.""How do you know this, Barrymore?""Well, Sir Henry, your uncle had a letter that morning. He hadusually a great many letters, for he was a public man and wellknown for his kind heart, so that everyone who was in trouble wasglad to turn to him. But that morning, as it chanced, there wasonly this one letter, so I took the more notice of it. It wasfrom Coombe Tracey, and it was addressed in a woman's hand.""Well?""Well, sir, I thought no more of the matter, and never would havedone had it not been for my wife. Only a few weeks ago she wascleaning out Sir Charles's study-it had never been touched sincehis death-and she found the ashes of a burned letter in the backof the grate. The greater part of it was charred to pieces, butone little slip, the end of a page, hung together, and thewriting could still be read, though it was grey on a blackground. It seemed to us to be a postscript at the end of theletter and it said: 'Please, please, as you are a gentleman, burnthis letter, and be at the gate by ten o clock. Beneath it weresigned the initials L. L.""Have you got that slip?""No, sir, it crumbled all to bits after we moved it.""Had Sir Charles received any other letters in the same writing?""Well, sir, I took no particular notice of his letters. I shouldnot have noticed this one, only it happened to come alone.""And you have no idea who L. L. is?""No, sir. No more than you have. But I expect if we could lay ourhands upon that lady we should know more about Sir Charles'sdeath.""I cannot understand, Barrymore, how you came to conceal thisimportant information.""Well, sir, it was immediately after that our own trouble came tous. And then again, sir, we were both of us very fond of SirCharles, as we well might be considering all that he has done forus. To rake this up couldn't help our poor master, and it's wellto go carefully when there's a lady in the case. Even the best ofus-""You thought it might injure his reputation?""Well, sir, I thought no good could come of it. But now you havebeen kind to us, and I feel as if it would be treating youunfairly not to tell you all that I know about the matter.""Very good, Barrymore; you can go." When the butler had left usSir Henry turned to me. "Well, Watson, what do you think of thisnew light?""It seems to leave the darkness rather blacker than before.""So I think. But if we can only trace L. L. it should clear upthe whole business. We have gained that much. We know that thereis someone who has the facts if we can only find her. What do youthink we should do?""Let Holmes know all about it at once. It will give him the cluefor which he has been seeking. I am much mistaken if it does notbring him down."I went at once to my room and drew up my report of the morning'sconversation for Holmes. It was evident to me that he had beenvery busy of late, for the notes which I had from Baker Streetwere few and short, with no comments upon the information which Ihad supplied and hardly any reference to my mission. No doubt hisblackmailing case is absorbing all his faculties. And yet thisnew factor must surely arrest his attention and renew hisinterest. I wish that he were here._October_ 17_th_.-All day today the rain poured down, rustling onthe ivy and dripping from the eaves. I thought of the convict outupon the bleak, cold, shelterless moor. Poor devil! Whatever hiscrimes, he has suffered something to atone for them. And then Ithought of that other one-the face in the cab, the figure againstthe moon. Was he also out in that deluged-the unseen watcher, theman of darkness? In the evening I put on my waterproof and Iwalked far upon the sodden moor, full of dark imaginings, therain beating upon my face and the wind whistling about my ears.God help those who wander into the great mire now, for even thefirm uplands are becoming a morass. I found the black tor uponwhich I had seen the solitary watcher, and from its craggy summitI looked out myself across the melancholy downs. Rain squallsdrifted across their russet face, and the heavy, slate-colouredclouds hung low over the landscape, trailing in grey wreaths downthe sides of the fantastic hills. In the distant hollow on theleft, half hidden by the mist, the two thin towers of BaskervilleHall rose above the trees. They were the only signs of human lifewhich I could see, save only those prehistoric huts which laythickly upon the slopes of the hills. Nowhere was there any traceof that lonely man whom I had seen on the same spot two nightsbefore.As I walked back I was overtaken by Dr. Mortimer driving in hisdog-cart over a rough moorland track which led from the outlyingfarmhouse of Foulmire. He has been very attentive to us, andhardly a day has passed that he has not called at the Hall to seehow we were getting on. He insisted upon my climbing into hisdog-cart, and he gave me a lift homeward. I found him muchtroubled over the disappearance of his little spaniel. It hadwandered on to the moor and had never come back. I gave him suchconsolation as I might, but I thought of the pony on the GrimpenMire, and I do not fancy that he will see his little dog again."By the way, Mortimer," said I as we jolted along the rough road,"I suppose there are few people living within driving distance ofthis whom you do not know?""Hardly any, I think.""Can you, then, tell me the name of any woman whose initials areL. L.?"He thought for a few minutes."No," said he. "There are a few gipsies and labouring folk forwhom I can't answer, but among the farmers or gentry there is noone whose initials are those. Wait a bit though," he added aftera pause. "There is Laura Lyons-her initials are L. L.-but shelives in Coombe Tracey.""Who is she?" I asked."She is Frankland's daughter.""What! Old Frankland the crank?""Exactly. She married an artist named Lyons, who came sketchingon the moor. He proved to be a blackguard and deserted her. Thefault from what I hear may not have been entirely on one side.Her father refused to have anything to do with her because shehad married without his consent and perhaps for one or two otherreasons as well. So, between the old sinner and the young one thegirl has had a pretty bad time.""How does she live?""I fancy old Frankland allows her a pittance, but it cannot bemore, for his own affairs are considerably involved. Whatever shemay have deserved one could not allow her to go hopelessly to thebad. Her story got about, and several of the people here didsomething to enable her to earn an honest living. Stapleton didfor one, and Sir Charles for another. I gave a trifle myself. Itwas to set her up in a typewriting business."He wanted to know the object of my inquiries, but I managed tosatisfy his curiosity without telling him too much, for there isno reason why we should take anyone into our confidence. Tomorrowmorning I shall find my way to Coombe Tracey, and if I can seethis Mrs. Laura Lyons, of equivocal reputation, a long step willhave been made towards clearing one incident in this chain ofmysteries. I am certainly developing the wisdom of the serpent,for when Mortimer pressed his questions to an inconvenient extentI asked him casually to what type Frankland's skull belonged, andso heard nothing but craniology for the rest of our drive. I havenot lived for years with Sherlock Holmes for nothing.I have only one other incident to record upon this tempestuousand melancholy day. This was my conversation with Barrymore justnow, which gives me one more strong card which I can play in duetime.Mortimer had stayed to dinner, and he and the baronet playedecarte afterwards. The butler brought me my coffee into thelibrary, and I took the chance to ask him a few questions."Well," said I, "has this precious relation of yours departed, oris he still lurking out yonder?""I don't know, sir. I hope to heaven that he has gone, for he hasbrought nothing but trouble here! I've not heard of him since Ileft out food for him last, and that was three days ago.""Did you see him then?""No, sir, but the food was gone when next I went that way.""Then he was certainly there?""So you would think, sir, unless it was the other man who tookit."I sat with my coffee-cup halfway to my lips and stared atBarrymore."You know that there is another man then?""Yes, sir; there is another man upon the moor.""Have you seen him?""No, sir.""How do you know of him then?""Selden told me of him, sir, a week ago or more. He's in hiding,too, but he's not a convict as far as I can make out. I don'tlike it, Dr. Watson-I tell you straight, sir, that I don't likeit." He spoke with a sudden passion of earnestness."Now, listen to me, Barrymore! I have no interest in this matterbut that of your master. I have come here with no object exceptto help him. Tell me, frankly, what it is that you don't like."Barrymore hesitated for a moment, as if he regretted his outburstor found it difficult to express his own feelings in words."It's all these goings-on, sir," he cried at last, waving hishand towards the rain-lashed window which faced the moor."There's foul play somewhere, and there's black villainy brewing,to that I'll swear! Very glad I should be, sir, to see Sir Henryon his way back to London again!""But what is it that alarms you?""Look at Sir Charles's death! That was bad enough, for all thatthe coroner said. Look at the noises on the moor at night.There's not a man would cross it after sundown if he was paid forit. Look at this stranger hiding out yonder, and watching andwaiting! What's he waiting for? What does it mean? It means nogood to anyone of the name of Baskerville, and very glad I shallbe to be quit of it all on the day that Sir Henry's new servantsare ready to take over the Hall.""But about this stranger," said I. "Can you tell me anythingabout him? What did Selden say? Did he find out where he hid, orwhat he was doing?""He saw him once or twice, but he is a deep one and gives nothingaway. At first he thought that he was the police, but soon hefound that he had some lay of his own. A kind of gentleman hewas, as far as he could see, but what he was doing he could notmake out.""And where did he say that he lived?""Among the old houses on the hillside-the stone huts where theold folk used to live.""But how about his food?""Selden found out that he has got a lad who works for him andbrings all he needs. I dare say he goes to Coombe Tracey for whathe wants.""Very good, Barrymore. We may talk further of this some othertime." When the butler had gone I walked over to the blackwindow, and I looked through a blurred pane at the driving cloudsand at the tossing outline of the wind-swept trees. It is a wildnight indoors, and what must it be in a stone hut upon the moor.What passion of hatred can it be which leads a man to lurk insuch a place at such a time! And what deep and earnest purposecan he have which calls for such a trial! There, in that hut uponthe moor, seems to lie the very centre of that problem which hasvexed me so sorely. I swear that another day shall not havepassed before I have done all that man can do to reach the heartof the mystery.Chapter 11.The Man on the TorThe extract from my private diary which forms the last chapterhas brought my narrative up to the eighteenth of October, a timewhen these strange events began to move swiftly towards theirterrible conclusion. The incidents of the next few days areindelibly graven upon my recollection, and I can tell themwithout reference to the notes made at the time. I start themfrom the day which succeeded that upon which I had establishedtwo facts of great importance, the one that Mrs. Laura Lyons ofCoombe Tracey had written to Sir Charles Baskerville and made anappointment with him at the very place and hour that he met hisdeath, the other that the lurking man upon the moor was to befound among the stone huts upon the hillside. With these twofacts in my possession I felt that either my intelligence or mycourage must be deficient if I could not throw some further lightupon these dark places.I had no opportunity to tell the baronet what I had learned aboutMrs. Lyons upon the evening before, for Dr. Mortimer remainedwith him at cards until it was very late. At breakfast, however,I informed him about my discovery and asked him whether he wouldcare to accompany me to Coombe Tracey. At first he was very eagerto come, but on second thoughts it seemed to both of us that if Iwent alone the results might be better. The more formal we madethe visit the less information we might obtain. I left Sir Henrybehind, therefore, not without some prickings of conscience, anddrove off upon my new quest.When I reached Coombe Tracey I told Perkins to put up the horses,and I made inquiries for the lady whom I had come to interrogate.I had no difficulty in finding her rooms, which were central andwell appointed. A maid showed me in without ceremony, and as Ientered the sitting-room a lady, who was sitting before aRemington typewriter, sprang up with a pleasant smile of welcome.Her face fell, however, when she saw that I was a stranger, andshe sat down again and asked me the object of my visit.The first impression left by Mrs. Lyons was one of extremebeauty. Her eyes and hair were of the same rich hazel colour, andher cheeks, though considerably freckled, were flushed with theexquisite bloom of the brunette, the dainty pink which lurks atthe heart of the sulphur rose. Admiration was, I repeat, thefirst impression. But the second was criticism. There wassomething subtly wrong with the face, some coarseness ofexpression, some hardness, perhaps, of eye, some looseness of lipwhich marred its perfect beauty. But these, of course, areafterthoughts. At the moment I was simply conscious that I was inthe presence of a very handsome woman, and that she was asking methe reasons for my visit. I had not quite understood until thatinstant how delicate my mission was."I have the pleasure," said I, "of knowing your father."It was a clumsy introduction, and the lady made me feel it."There is nothing in common between my father and me," she said."I owe him nothing, and his friends are not mine. If it were notfor the late Sir Charles Baskerville and some other kind hearts Imight have starved for all that my father cared.""It was about the late Sir Charles Baskerville that I have comehere to see you."The freckles started out on the lady's face."What can I tell you about him?" she asked, and her fingersplayed nervously over the stops of her typewriter."You knew him, did you not?""I have already said that I owe a great deal to his kindness. IfI am able to support myself it is largely due to the interestwhich he took in my unhappy situation.""Did you correspond with him?"The lady looked quickly up with an angry gleam in her hazel eyes."What is the object of these questions?" she asked sharply."The object is to avoid a public scandal. It is better that Ishould ask them here than that the matter should pass outside ourcontrol."She was silent and her face was still very pale. At last shelooked up with something reckless and defiant in her manner."Well, I'll answer," she said. "What are your questions?""Did you correspond with Sir Charles?""I certainly wrote to him once or twice to acknowledge hisdelicacy and his generosity.""Have you the dates of those letters?""No.""Have you ever met him?""Yes, once or twice, when he came into Coombe Tracey. He was avery retiring man, and he preferred to do good by stealth.""But if you saw him so seldom and wrote so seldom, how did heknow enough about your affairs to be able to help you, as you saythat he has done?"She met my difficulty with the utmost readiness."There were several gentlemen who knew my sad history and unitedto help me. One was Mr. Stapleton, a neighbour and intimatefriend of Sir Charles's. He was exceedingly kind, and it wasthrough him that Sir Charles learned about my affairs."I knew already that Sir Charles Baskerville had made Stapletonhis almoner upon several occasions, so the lady's statement borethe impress of truth upon it."Did you ever write to Sir Charles asking him to meet you?" Icontinued.Mrs. Lyons flushed with anger again. "Really, sir, this is a veryextraordinary question.""I am sorry, madam, but I must repeat it.""Then I answer, certainly not.""Not on the very day of Sir Charles's death?"The flush had faded in an instant, and a deathly face was beforeme. Her dry lips could not speak the "No" which I saw rather thanheard."Surely your memory deceives you," said I. "I could even quote apassage of your letter. It ran 'Please, please, as you are agentleman, burn this letter, and be at the gate by ten o'clock.'"I thought that she had fainted, but she recovered herself by asupreme effort."Is there no such thing as a gentleman?" she gasped."You do Sir Charles an injustice. He _did_ burn the letter. Butsometimes a letter may be legible even when burned. Youacknowledge now that you wrote it?""Yes, I did write it," she cried, pouring out her soul in atorrent of words. "I did write it. Why should I deny it? I haveno reason to be ashamed of it. I wished him to help me. Ibelieved that if I had an interview I could gain his help, so Iasked him to meet me.""But why at such an hour?""Because I had only just learned that he was going to London nextday and might be away for months. There were reasons why I couldnot get there earlier.""But why a rendezvous in the garden instead of a visit to thehouse?""Do you think a woman could go alone at that hour to a bachelor'shouse?""Well, what happened when you did get there?""I never went.""Mrs. Lyons!""No, I swear it to you on all I hold sacred. I never went.Something intervened to prevent my going.""What was that?""That is a private matter. I cannot tell it.""You acknowledge then that you made an appointment with SirCharles at the very hour and place at which he met his death, butyou deny that you kept the appointment.""That is the truth."Again and again I cross-questioned her, but I could never getpast that point."Mrs. Lyons," said I as I rose from this long and inconclusiveinterview, "you are taking a very great responsibility andputting yourself in a very false position by not making anabsolutely clean breast of all that you know. If I have to callin the aid of the police you will find how seriously you arecompromised. If your position is innocent, why did you in thefirst instance deny having written to Sir Charles upon thatdate?""Because I feared that some false conclusion might be drawn fromit and that I might find myself involved in a scandal.""And why were you so pressing that Sir Charles should destroyyour letter?""If you have read the letter you will know.""I did not say that I had read all the letter.""You quoted some of it.""I quoted the postscript. The letter had, as I said, been burnedand it was not all legible. I ask you once again why it was thatyou were so pressing that Sir Charles should destroy this letterwhich he received on the day of his death.""The matter is a very private one.""The more reason why you should avoid a public investigation.""I will tell you, then. If you have heard anything of my unhappyhistory you will know that I made a rash marriage and had reasonto regret it.""I have heard so much.""My life has been one incessant persecution from a husband whom Iabhor. The law is upon his side, and every day I am faced by thepossibility that he may force me to live with him. At the timethat I wrote this letter to Sir Charles I had learned that therewas a prospect of my regaining my freedom if certain expensescould be met. It meant everything to me-peace of mind, happiness,self-respect-everything. I knew Sir Charles's generosity, and Ithought that if he heard the story from my own lips he would helpme.""Then how is it that you did not go?""Because I received help in the interval from another source.""Why then, did you not write to Sir Charles and explain this?""So I should have done had I not seen his death in the paper nextmorning."The woman's story hung coherently together, and all my questionswere unable to shake it. I could only check it by finding if shehad, indeed, instituted divorce proceedings against her husbandat or about the time of the tragedy.It was unlikely that she would dare to say that she had not beento Baskerville Hall if she really had been, for a trap would benecessary to take her there, and could not have returned toCoombe Tracey until the early hours of the morning. Such anexcursion could not be kept secret. The probability was,therefore, that she was telling the truth, or, at least, a partof the truth. I came away baffled and disheartened. Once again Ihad reached that dead wall which seemed to be built across everypath by which I tried to get at the object of my mission. And yetthe more I thought of the lady's face and of her manner the moreI felt that something was being held back from me. Why should sheturn so pale? Why should she fight against every admission untilit was forced from her? Why should she have been so reticent atthe time of the tragedy? Surely the explanation of all this couldnot be as innocent as she would have me believe. For the moment Icould proceed no farther in that direction, but must turn back tothat other clue which was to be sought for among the stone hutsupon the moor.And that was a most vague direction. I realised it as I droveback and noted how hill after hill showed traces of the ancientpeople. Barrymore's only indication had been that the strangerlived in one of these abandoned huts, and many hundreds of themare scattered throughout the length and breadth of the moor. ButI had my own experience for a guide since it had shown me the manhimself standing upon the summit of the Black Tor. That, then,should be the centre of my search. From there I should exploreevery hut upon the moor until I lighted upon the right one. Ifthis man were inside it I should find out from his own lips, atthe point of my revolver if necessary, who he was and why he haddogged us so long. He might slip away from us in the crowd ofRegent Street, but it would puzzle him to do so upon the lonelymoor. On the other hand, if I should find the hut and its tenantshould not be within it I must remain there, however long thevigil, until he returned. Holmes had missed him in London. Itwould indeed be a triumph for me if I could run him to earthwhere my master had failed.Luck had been against us again and again in this inquiry, but nowat last it came to my aid. And the messenger of good fortune wasnone other than Mr. Frankland, who was standing, grey-whiskeredand red-faced, outside the gate of his garden, which opened on tothe highroad along which I travelled."Good-day, Dr. Watson," cried he with unwonted good humour, "youmust really give your horses a rest and come in to have a glassof wine and to congratulate me."My feelings towards him were very far from being friendly afterwhat I had heard of his treatment of his daughter, but I wasanxious to send Perkins and the wagonette home, and theopportunity was a good one. I alighted and sent a message to SirHenry that I should walk over in time for dinner. Then I followedFrankland into his dining-room."It is a great day for me, sir-one of the red-letter days of mylife," he cried with many chuckles. "I have brought off a doubleevent. I mean to teach them in these parts that law is law, andthat there is a man here who does not fear to invoke it. I haveestablished a right of way through the centre of old Middleton'spark, slap across it, sir, within a hundred yards of his ownfront door. What do you think of that? We'll teach these magnatesthat they cannot ride roughshod over the rights of the commoners,confound them! And I've closed the wood where the Fernworthy folkused to picnic. These infernal people seem to think that thereare no rights of property, and that they can swarm where theylike with their papers and their bottles. Both cases decided, Dr.Watson, and both in my favour. I haven't had such a day since Ihad Sir John Morland for trespass because he shot in his ownwarren.""How on earth did you do that?""Look it up in the books, sir. It will repay reading-Frankland_v_. Morland, Court of Queen's Bench. It cost me p200, but I gotmy verdict.""Did it do you any good?""None, sir, none. I am proud to say that I had no interest in thematter. I act entirely from a sense of public duty. I have nodoubt, for example, that the Fernworthy people will burn me ineffigy tonight. I told the police last time they did it that theyshould stop these disgraceful exhibitions. The CountyConstabulary is in a scandalous state, sir, and it has notafforded me the protection to which I am entitled. The case ofFrankland _v_. Regina will bring the matter before the attentionof the public. I told them that they would have occasion toregret their treatment of me, and already my words have cometrue.""How so?" I asked.The old man put on a very knowing expression. "Because I couldtell them what they are dying to know; but nothing would induceme to help the rascals in any way."I had been casting round for some excuse by which I could getaway from his gossip, but now I began to wish to hear more of it.I had seen enough of the contrary nature of the old sinner tounderstand that any strong sign of interest would be the surestway to stop his confidences."Some poaching case, no doubt?" said I with an indifferentmanner."Ha, ha, my boy, a very much more important matter than that!What about the convict on the moor?"I stared. "You don't mean that you know where he is?" said I."I may not know exactly where he is, but I am quite sure that Icould help the police to lay their hands on him. Has it neverstruck you that the way to catch that man was to find out wherehe got his food and so trace it to him?"He certainly seemed to be getting uncomfortably near the truth."No doubt," said I; "but how do you know that he is anywhere uponthe moor?""I know it because I have seen with my own eyes the messenger whotakes him his food."My heart sank for Barrymore. It was a serious thing to be in thepower of this spiteful old busybody. But his next remark took aweight from my mind."You'll be surprised to hear that his food is taken to him by achild. I see him every day through my telescope upon the roof. Hepasses along the same path at the same hour, and to whom shouldhe be going except to the convict?"Here was luck indeed! And yet I suppressed all appearance ofinterest. A child! Barrymore had said that our unknown wassupplied by a boy. It was on his track, and not upon theconvict's, that Frankland had stumbled. If I could get hisknowledge it might save me a long and weary hunt. But incredulityand indifference were evidently my strongest cards."I should say that it was much more likely that it was the son ofone of the moorland shepherds taking out his father's dinner."The least appearance of opposition struck fire out of the oldautocrat. His eyes looked malignantly at me, and his greywhiskers bristled like those of an angry cat."Indeed, sir!" said he, pointing out over the wide-stretchingmoor. "Do you see that Black Tor over yonder? Well, do you seethe low hill beyond with the thornbush upon it? It is thestoniest part of the whole moor. Is that a place where a shepherdwould be likely to take his station? Your suggestion, sir, is amost absurd one."I meekly answered that I had spoken without knowing all thefacts. My submission pleased him and led him to furtherconfidences."You may be sure, sir, that I have very good grounds before Icome to an opinion. I have seen the boy again and again with hisbundle. Every day, and sometimes twice a day, I have beenable-but wait a moment, Dr. Watson. Do my eyes deceive me, or isthere at the present moment something moving upon that hillside?"It was several miles off, but I could distinctly see a small darkdot against the dull green and grey."Come, sir, come!" cried Frankland, rushing upstairs. "You willsee with your own eyes and judge for yourself."The telescope, a formidable instrument mounted upon a tripod,stood upon the flat leads of the house. Frankland clapped his eyeto it and gave a cry of satisfaction."Quick, Dr. Watson, quick, before he passes over the hill!"There he was, sure enough, a small urchin with a little bundleupon his shoulder, toiling slowly up the hill. When he reachedthe crest I saw the ragged uncouth figure outlined for an instantagainst the cold blue sky. He looked round him with a furtive andstealthy air, as one who dreads pursuit. Then he vanished overthe hill."Well! Am I right?""Certainly, there is a boy who seems to have some secret errand.""And what the errand is even a county constable could guess. Butnot one word shall they have from me, and I bind you to secrecyalso, Dr. Watson. Not a word! You understand!""Just as you wish.""They have treated me shamefully-shamefully. When the facts comeout in Frankland _v_. Regina I venture to think that a thrill ofindignation will run through the country. Nothing would induce meto help the police in any way. For all they cared it might havebeen me, instead of my effigy, which these rascals burned at thestake. Surely you are not going! You will help me to empty thedecanter in honour of this great occasion!"But I resisted all his solicitations and succeeded in dissuadinghim from his announced intention of walking home with me. I keptthe road as long as his eye was on me, and then I struck offacross the moor and made for the stony hill over which the boyhad disappeared. Everything was working in my favour, and I sworethat it should not be through lack of energy or perseverance thatI should miss the chance which fortune had thrown in my way.The sun was already sinking when I reached the summit of thehill, and the long slopes beneath me were all golden-green on oneside and grey shadow on the other. A haze lay low upon thefarthest sky-line, out of which jutted the fantastic shapes ofBelliver and Vixen Tor. Over the wide expanse there was no soundand no movement. One great grey bird, a gull or curlew, soaredaloft in the blue heaven. He and I seemed to be the only livingthings between the huge arch of the sky and the desert beneathit. The barren scene, the sense of loneliness, and the mysteryand urgency of my task all struck a chill into my heart. The boywas nowhere to be seen. But down beneath me in a cleft of thehills there was a circle of the old stone huts, and in the middleof them there was one which retained sufficient roof to act as ascreen against the weather. My heart leaped within me as I sawit. This must be the burrow where the stranger lurked. At last myfoot was on the threshold of his hiding place-his secret waswithin my grasp.As I approached the hut, walking as warily as Stapleton would dowhen with poised net he drew near the settled butterfly, Isatisfied myself that the place had indeed been used as ahabitation. A vague pathway among the boulders led to thedilapidated opening which served as a door. All was silentwithin. The unknown might be lurking there, or he might beprowling on the moor. My nerves tingled with the sense ofadventure. Throwing aside my cigarette, I closed my hand upon thebutt of my revolver and, walking swiftly up to the door, I lookedin. The place was empty.But there were ample signs that I had not come upon a falsescent. This was certainly where the man lived. Some blanketsrolled in a waterproof lay upon that very stone slab upon whichNeolithic man had once slumbered. The ashes of a fire were heapedin a rude grate. Beside it lay some cooking utensils and a buckethalf-full of water. A litter of empty tins showed that the placehad been occupied for some time, and I saw, as my eyes becameaccustomed to the checkered light, a pannikin and a half-fullbottle of spirits standing in the corner. In the middle of thehut a flat stone served the purpose of a table, and upon thisstood a small cloth bundle-the same, no doubt, which I had seenthrough the telescope upon the shoulder of the boy. It containeda loaf of bread, a tinned tongue, and two tins of preservedpeaches. As I set it down again, after having examined it, myheart leaped to see that beneath it there lay a sheet of paperwith writing upon it. I raised it, and this was what I read,roughly scrawled in pencil: "Dr. Watson has gone to CoombeTracey."For a minute I stood there with the paper in my hands thinkingout the meaning of this curt message. It was I, then, and not SirHenry, who was being dogged by this secret man. He had notfollowed me himself, but he had set an agent-the boy,perhaps-upon my track, and this was his report. Possibly I hadtaken no step since I had been upon the moor which had not beenobserved and reported. Always there was this feeling of an unseenforce, a fine net drawn round us with infinite skill anddelicacy, holding us so lightly that it was only at some suprememoment that one realised that one was indeed entangled in itsmeshes.If there was one report there might be others, so I looked roundthe hut in search of them. There was no trace, however, ofanything of the kind, nor could I discover any sign which mightindicate the character or intentions of the man who lived in thissingular place, save that he must be of Spartan habits and caredlittle for the comforts of life. When I thought of the heavyrains and looked at the gaping roof I understood how strong andimmutable must be the purpose which had kept him in thatinhospitable abode. Was he our malignant enemy, or was he bychance our guardian angel? I swore that I would not leave the hutuntil I knew.Outside the sun was sinking low and the west was blazing withscarlet and gold. Its reflection was shot back in ruddy patchesby the distant pools which lay amid the great Grimpen Mire. Therewere the two towers of Baskerville Hall, and there a distant blurof smoke which marked the village of Grimpen. Between the two,behind the hill, was the house of the Stapletons. All was sweetand mellow and peaceful in the golden evening light, and yet as Ilooked at them my soul shared none of the peace of Nature butquivered at the vagueness and the terror of that interview whichevery instant was bringing nearer. With tingling nerves but afixed purpose, I sat in the dark recess of the hut and waitedwith sombre patience for the coming of its tenant.And then at last I heard him. Far away came the sharp clink of aboot striking upon a stone. Then another and yet another, comingnearer and nearer. I shrank back into the darkest corner andcocked the pistol in my pocket, determined not to discover myselfuntil I had an opportunity of seeing something of the stranger.There was a long pause which showed that he had stopped. Thenonce more the footsteps approached and a shadow fell across theopening of the hut."It is a lovely evening, my dear Watson," said a well-knownvoice. "I really think that you will be more comfortable outsidethan in."Chapter 12.Death on the MoorFor a moment or two I sat breathless, hardly able to believe myears. Then my senses and my voice came back to me, while acrushing weight of responsibility seemed in an instant to belifted from my soul. That cold, incisive, ironical voice couldbelong to but one man in all the world."Holmes!" I cried-"Holmes!""Come out," said he, "and please be careful with the revolver."I stooped under the rude lintel, and there he sat upon a stoneoutside, his grey eyes dancing with amusement as they fell uponmy astonished features. He was thin and worn, but clear andalert, his keen face bronzed by the sun and roughened by thewind. In his tweed suit and cloth cap he looked like any othertourist upon the moor, and he had contrived, with that catlikelove of personal cleanliness which was one of hischaracteristics, that his chin should be as smooth and his linenas perfect as if he were in Baker Street."I never was more glad to see anyone in my life," said I as Iwrung him by the hand."Or more astonished, eh?""Well, I must confess to it.""The surprise was not all on one side, I assure you. I had noidea that you had found my occasional retreat, still less thatyou were inside it, until I was within twenty paces of the door.""My footprint, I presume?""No, Watson, I fear that I could not undertake to recognize yourfootprint amid all the footprints of the world. If you seriouslydesire to deceive me you must change your tobacconist; for when Isee the stub of a cigarette marked Bradley, Oxford Street, I knowthat my friend Watson is in the neighbourhood. You will see itthere beside the path. You threw it down, no doubt, at thatsupreme moment when you charged into the empty hut.""Exactly.""I thought as much-and knowing your admirable tenacity I wasconvinced that you were sitting in ambush, a weapon within reach,waiting for the tenant to return. So you actually thought that Iwas the criminal?""I did not know who you were, but I was determined to find out.""Excellent, Watson! And how did you localise me? You saw me,perhaps, on the night of the convict hunt, when I was soimprudent as to allow the moon to rise behind me?""Yes, I saw you then.""And have no doubt searched all the huts until you came to thisone?""No, your boy had been observed, and that gave me a guide whereto look.""The old gentleman with the telescope, no doubt. I could not makeit out when first I saw the light flashing upon the lens." Herose and peeped into the hut. "Ha, I see that Cartwright hasbrought up some supplies. What's this paper? So you have been toCoombe Tracey, have you?""Yes.""To see Mrs. Laura Lyons?""Exactly.""Well done! Our researches have evidently been running onparallel lines, and when we unite our results I expect we shallhave a fairly full knowledge of the case.""Well, I am glad from my heart that you are here, for indeed theresponsibility and the mystery were both becoming too much for mynerves. But how in the name of wonder did you come here, and whathave you been doing? I thought that you were in Baker Streetworking out that case of blackmailing.""That was what I wished you to think.""Then you use me, and yet do not trust me!" I cried with somebitterness. "I think that I have deserved better at your hands,Holmes.""My dear fellow, you have been invaluable to me in this as inmany other cases, and I beg that you will forgive me if I haveseemed to play a trick upon you. In truth, it was partly for yourown sake that I did it, and it was my appreciation of the dangerwhich you ran which led me to come down and examine the matterfor myself. Had I been with Sir Henry and you it is confidentthat my point of view would have been the same as yours, and mypresence would have warned our very formidable opponents to be ontheir guard. As it is, I have been able to get about as I couldnot possibly have done had I been living in the Hall, and Iremain an unknown factor in the business, ready to throw in allmy weight at a critical moment.""But why keep me in the dark?""For you to know could not have helped us and might possibly haveled to my discovery. You would have wished to tell me something,or in your kindness you would have brought me out some comfort orother, and so an unnecessary risk would be run. I broughtCartwright down with me-you remember the little chap at theexpress office-and he has seen after my simple wants: a loaf ofbread and a clean collar. What does man want more? He has givenme an extra pair of eyes upon a very active pair of feet, andboth have been invaluable.""Then my reports have all been wasted!"-My voice trembled as Irecalled the pains and the pride with which I had composed them.Holmes took a bundle of papers from his pocket."Here are your reports, my dear fellow, and very well thumbed, Iassure you. I made excellent arrangements, and they are onlydelayed one day upon their way. I must compliment you exceedinglyupon the zeal and the intelligence which you have shown over anextraordinarily difficult case."I was still rather raw over the deception which had beenpractised upon me, but the warmth of Holmes's praise drove myanger from my mind. I felt also in my heart that he was right inwhat he said and that it was really best for our purpose that Ishould not have known that he was upon the moor."That's better," said he, seeing the shadow rise from my face."And now tell me the result of your visit to Mrs. Laura Lyons-itwas not difficult for me to guess that it was to see her that youhad gone, for I am already aware that she is the one person inCoombe Tracey who might be of service to us in the matter. Infact, if you had not gone today it is exceedingly probable that Ishould have gone tomorrow."The sun had set and dusk was settling over the moor. The air hadturned chill and we withdrew into the hut for warmth. There,sitting together in the twilight, I told Holmes of myconversation with the lady. So interested was he that I had torepeat some of it twice before he was satisfied."This is most important," said he when I had concluded. "It fillsup a gap which I had been unable to bridge in this most complexaffair. You are aware, perhaps, that a close intimacy existsbetween this lady and the man Stapleton?""I did not know of a close intimacy.""There can be no doubt about the matter. They meet, they write,there is a complete understanding between them. Now, this puts avery powerful weapon into our hands. If I could only use it todetach his wife-""His wife?""I am giving you some information now, in return for all that youhave given me. The lady who has passed here as Miss Stapleton isin reality his wife.""Good heavens, Holmes! Are you sure of what you say? How could hehave permitted Sir Henry to fall in love with her?""Sir Henry's falling in love could do no harm to anyone exceptSir Henry. He took particular care that Sir Henry did not makelove to her, as you have yourself observed. I repeat that thelady is his wife and not his sister.""But why this elaborate deception?""Because he foresaw that she would be very much more useful tohim in the character of a free woman."All my unspoken instincts, my vague suspicions, suddenly tookshape and centred upon the naturalist. In that impassivecolourless man, with his straw hat and his butterfly-net, Iseemed to see something terrible-a creature of infinite patienceand craft, with a smiling face and a murderous heart."It is he, then, who is our enemy-it is he who dogged us inLondon?""So I read the riddle.""And the warning-it must have come from her!""Exactly."The shape of some monstrous villainy, half seen, half guessed,loomed through the darkness which had girt me so long."But are you sure of this, Holmes? How do you know that the womanis his wife?""Because he so far forgot himself as to tell you a true piece ofautobiography upon the occasion when he first met you, and I daresay he has many a time regretted it since. He was once aschoolmaster in the north of England. Now, there is no one moreeasy to trace than a schoolmaster. There are scholastic agenciesby which one may identify any man who has been in the profession.A little investigation showed me that a school had come to griefunder atrocious circumstances, and that the man who had ownedit-the name was different-had disappeared with his wife. Thedescriptions agreed. When I learned that the missing man wasdevoted to entomology the identification was complete."The darkness was rising, but much was still hidden by theshadows."If this woman is in truth his wife, where does Mrs. Laura Lyonscome in?" I asked."That is one of the points upon which your own researches haveshed a light. Your interview with the lady has cleared thesituation very much. I did not know about a projected divorcebetween herself and her husband. In that case, regardingStapleton as an unmarried man, she counted no doubt upon becominghis wife.""And when she is undeceived?""Why, then we may find the lady of service. It must be our firstduty to see her-both of us-tomorrow. Don't you think, Watson,that you are away from your charge rather long? Your place shouldbe at Baskerville Hall."The last red streaks had faded away in the west and night hadsettled upon the moor. A few faint stars were gleaming in aviolet sky."One last question, Holmes," I said as I rose. "Surely there isno need of secrecy between you and me. What is the meaning of itall? What is he after?"Holmes's voice sank as he answered:"It is murder, Watson-refined, cold-blooded, deliberate murder.Do not ask me for particulars. My nets are closing upon him, evenas his are upon Sir Henry, and with your help he is alreadyalmost at my mercy. There is but one danger which can threatenus. It is that he should strike before we are ready to do so.Another day-two at the most-and I have my case complete, butuntil then guard your charge as closely as ever a fond motherwatched her ailing child. Your mission today has justifieditself, and yet I could almost wish that you had not left hisside. Hark!"A terrible scream-a prolonged yell of horror and anguish-burstout of the silence of the moor. That frightful cry turned theblood to ice in my veins."Oh, my God!" I gasped. "What is it? What does it mean?"Holmes had sprung to his feet, and I saw his dark, athleticoutline at the door of the hut, his shoulders stooping, his headthrust forward, his face peering into the darkness."Hush!" he whispered. "Hush!"The cry had been loud on account of its vehemence, but it hadpealed out from somewhere far off on the shadowy plain. Now itburst upon our ears, nearer, louder, more urgent than before."Where is it?" Holmes whispered; and I knew from the thrill ofhis voice that he, the man of iron, was shaken to the soul."Where is it, Watson?""There, I think." I pointed into the darkness."No, there!"Again the agonised cry swept through the silent night, louder andmuch nearer than ever. And a new sound mingled with it, a deep,muttered rumble, musical and yet menacing, rising and fallinglike the low, constant murmur of the sea."The hound!" cried Holmes. "Come, Watson, come! Great heavens, ifwe are too late!"He had started running swiftly over the moor, and I had followedat his heels. But now from somewhere among the broken groundimmediately in front of us there came one last despairing yell,and then a dull, heavy thud. We halted and listened. Not anothersound broke the heavy silence of the windless night.I saw Holmes put his hand to his forehead like a man distracted.He stamped his feet upon the ground."He has beaten us, Watson. We are too late.""No, no, surely not!""Fool that I was to hold my hand. And you, Watson, see what comesof abandoning your charge! But, by Heaven, if the worst hashappened we'll avenge him!"Blindly we ran through the gloom, blundering against boulders,forcing our way through gorse bushes, panting up hills andrushing down slopes, heading always in the direction whence thosedreadful sounds had come. At every rise Holmes looked eagerlyround him, but the shadows were thick upon the moor, and nothingmoved upon its dreary face."Can you see anything?""Nothing.""But, hark, what is that?"A low moan had fallen upon our ears. There it was again upon ourleft! On that side a ridge of rocks ended in a sheer cliff whichoverlooked a stone-strewn slope. On its jagged face wasspread-eagled some dark, irregular object. As we ran towards itthe vague outline hardened into a definite shape. It was aprostrate man face downward upon the ground, the head doubledunder him at a horrible angle, the shoulders rounded and the bodyhunched together as if in the act of throwing a somersault. Sogrotesque was the attitude that I could not for the instantrealise that that moan had been the passing of his soul. Not awhisper, not a rustle, rose now from the dark figure over whichwe stooped. Holmes laid his hand upon him and held it up againwith an exclamation of horror. The gleam of the match which hestruck shone upon his clotted fingers and upon the ghastly poolwhich widened slowly from the crushed skull of the victim. And itshone upon something else which turned our hearts sick and faintwithin us-the body of Sir Henry Baskerville!There was no chance of either of us forgetting that peculiarruddy tweed suit-the very one which he had worn on the firstmorning that we had seen him in Baker Street. We caught the oneclear glimpse of it, and then the match flickered and went out,even as the hope had gone out of our souls. Holmes groaned, andhis face glimmered white through the darkness."The brute! The brute!" I cried with clenched hands. "Oh Holmes,I shall never forgive myself for having left him to his fate.""I am more to blame than you, Watson. In order to have my casewell rounded and complete, I have thrown away the life of myclient. It is the greatest blow which has befallen me in mycareer. But how could I know-how _could_ I know-that he wouldrisk his life alone upon the moor in the face of all mywarnings?""That we should have heard his screams-my God, those screams!-andyet have been unable to save him! Where is this brute of a houndwhich drove him to his death? It may be lurking among these rocksat this instant. And Stapleton, where is he? He shall answer forthis deed.""He shall. I will see to that. Uncle and nephew have beenmurdered-the one frightened to death by the very sight of a beastwhich he thought to be supernatural, the other driven to his endin his wild flight to escape from it. But now we have to provethe connection between the man and the beast. Save from what weheard, we cannot even swear to the existence of the latter, sinceSir Henry has evidently died from the fall. But, by heavens,cunning as he is, the fellow shall be in my power before anotherday is past!"We stood with bitter hearts on either side of the mangled body,overwhelmed by this sudden and irrevocable disaster which hadbrought all our long and weary labours to so piteous an end. Thenas the moon rose we climbed to the top of the rocks over whichour poor friend had fallen, and from the summit we gazed out overthe shadowy moor, half silver and half gloom. Far away, milesoff, in the direction of Grimpen, a single steady yellow lightwas shining. It could only come from the lonely abode of theStapletons. With a bitter curse I shook my fist at it as I gazed."Why should we not seize him at once?""Our case is not complete. The fellow is wary and cunning to thelast degree. It is not what we know, but what we can prove. If wemake one false move the villain may escape us yet.""What can we do?""There will be plenty for us to do tomorrow. Tonight we can onlyperform the last offices to our poor friend."Together we made our way down the precipitous slope andapproached the body, black and clear against the silvered stones.The agony of those contorted limbs struck me with a spasm of painand blurred my eyes with tears."We must send for help, Holmes! We cannot carry him all the wayto the Hall. Good heavens, are you mad?"He had uttered a cry and bent over the body. Now he was dancingand laughing and wringing my hand. Could this be my stern,self-contained friend? These were hidden fires, indeed!"A beard! A beard! The man has a beard!""A beard?""It is not the baronet-it is-why, it is my neighbour, theconvict!"With feverish haste we had turned the body over, and thatdripping beard was pointing up to the cold, clear moon. Therecould be no doubt about the beetling forehead, the sunken animaleyes. It was indeed the same face which had glared upon me in thelight of the candle from over the rock-the face of Selden, thecriminal.Then in an instant it was all clear to me. I remembered how thebaronet had told me that he had handed his old wardrobe toBarrymore. Barrymore had passed it on in order to help Selden inhis escape. Boots, shirt, cap-it was all Sir Henry's. The tragedywas still black enough, but this man had at least deserved deathby the laws of his country. I told Holmes how the matter stood,my heart bubbling over with thankfulness and joy."Then the clothes have been the poor devil's death," said he. "Itis clear enough that the hound has been laid on from some articleof Sir Henry's-the boot which was abstracted in the hotel, in allprobability-and so ran this man down. There is one very singularthing, however: How came Selden, in the darkness, to know thatthe hound was on his trail?""He heard him.""To hear a hound upon the moor would not work a hard man likethis convict into such a paroxysm of terror that he would riskrecapture by screaming wildly for help. By his cries he must haverun a long way after he knew the animal was on his track. How didhe know?""A greater mystery to me is why this hound, presuming that allour conjectures are correct-""I presume nothing.""Well, then, why this hound should be loose tonight. I supposethat it does not always run loose upon the moor. Stapleton wouldnot let it go unless he had reason to think that Sir Henry wouldbe there.""My difficulty is the more formidable of the two, for I thinkthat we shall very shortly get an explanation of yours, whilemine may remain forever a mystery. The question now is, whatshall we do with this poor wretch's body? We cannot leave it hereto the foxes and the ravens.""I suggest that we put it in one of the huts until we cancommunicate with the police.""Exactly. I have no doubt that you and I could carry it so far.Halloa, Watson, what's this? It's the man himself, by all that'swonderful and audacious! Not a word to show your suspicions-not aword, or my plans crumble to the ground."A figure was approaching us over the moor, and I saw the dull redglow of a cigar. The moon shone upon him, and I could distinguishthe dapper shape and jaunty walk of the naturalist. He stoppedwhen he saw us, and then came on again."Why, Dr. Watson, that's not you, is it? You are the last manthat I should have expected to see out on the moor at this timeof night. But, dear me, what's this? Somebody hurt? Not-don'ttell me that it is our friend Sir Henry!" He hurried past me andstooped over the dead man. I heard a sharp intake of his breathand the cigar fell from his fingers."Who-who's this?" he stammered."It is Selden, the man who escaped from Princetown."Stapleton turned a ghastly face upon us, but by a supreme efforthe had overcome his amazement and his disappointment. He lookedsharply from Holmes to me. "Dear me! What a very shocking affair!How did he die?""He appears to have broken his neck by falling over these rocks.My friend and I were strolling on the moor when we heard a cry.""I heard a cry also. That was what brought me out. I was uneasyabout Sir Henry.""Why about Sir Henry in particular?" I could not help asking."Because I had suggested that he should come over. When he didnot come I was surprised, and I naturally became alarmed for hissafety when I heard cries upon the moor. By the way"-his eyesdarted again from my face to Holmes's-"did you hear anything elsebesides a cry?""No," said Holmes; "did you?""No.""What do you mean, then?""Oh, you know the stories that the peasants tell about a phantomhound, and so on. It is said to be heard at night upon the moor.I was wondering if there were any evidence of such a soundtonight.""We heard nothing of the kind," said I."And what is your theory of this poor fellow's death?""I have no doubt that anxiety and exposure have driven him offhis head. He has rushed about the moor in a crazy state andeventually fallen over here and broken his neck.""That seems the most reasonable theory," said Stapleton, and hegave a sigh which I took to indicate his relief. "What do youthink about it, Mr. Sherlock Holmes?"My friend bowed his compliments. "You are quick atidentification," said he."We have been expecting you in these parts since Dr. Watson camedown. You are in time to see a tragedy.""Yes, indeed. I have no doubt that my friend's explanation willcover the facts. I will take an unpleasant remembrance back toLondon with me tomorrow.""Oh, you return tomorrow?""That is my intention.""I hope your visit has cast some light upon those occurrenceswhich have puzzled us?"Holmes shrugged his shoulders."One cannot always have the success for which one hopes. Aninvestigator needs facts and not legends or rumours. It has notbeen a satisfactory case."My friend spoke in his frankest and most unconcerned manner.Stapleton still looked hard at him. Then he turned to me."I would suggest carrying this poor fellow to my house, but itwould give my sister such a fright that I do not feel justifiedin doing it. I think that if we put something over his face hewill be safe until morning."And so it was arranged. Resisting Stapleton's offer ofhospitality, Holmes and I set off to Baskerville Hall, leavingthe naturalist to return alone. Looking back we saw the figuremoving slowly away over the broad moor, and behind him that oneblack smudge on the silvered slope which showed where the man waslying who had come so horribly to his end."We're at close grips at last," said Holmes as we walked togetheracross the moor. "What a nerve the fellow has! How he pulledhimself together in the face of what must have been a paralyzingshock when he found that the wrong man had fallen a victim to hisplot. I told you in London, Watson, and I tell you now again,that we have never had a foeman more worthy of our steel.""I am sorry that he has seen you.""And so was I at first. But there was no getting out of it.""What effect do you think it will have upon his plans now that heknows you are here?""It may cause him to be more cautious, or it may drive him todesperate measures at once. Like most clever criminals, he may betoo confident in his own cleverness and imagine that he hascompletely deceived us.""Why should we not arrest him at once?""My dear Watson, you were born to be a man of action. Yourinstinct is always to do something energetic. But supposing, forargument's sake, that we had him arrested tonight, what on earththe better off should we be for that? We could prove nothingagainst him. There's the devilish cunning of it! If he wereacting through a human agent we could get some evidence, but ifwe were to drag this great dog to the light of day it would nothelp us in putting a rope round the neck of its master.""Surely we have a case.""Not a shadow of one-only surmise and conjecture. We should belaughed out of court if we came with such a story and suchevidence.""There is Sir Charles's death.""Found dead without a mark upon him. You and I know that he diedof sheer fright, and we know also what frightened him, but howare we to get twelve stolid jurymen to know it? What signs arethere of a hound? Where are the marks of its fangs? Of course weknow that a hound does not bite a dead body and that Sir Charleswas dead before ever the brute overtook him. But we have to proveall this, and we are not in a position to do it.""Well, then, tonight?""We are not much better off tonight. Again, there was no directconnection between the hound and the man's death. We never sawthe hound. We heard it, but we could not prove that it wasrunning upon this man's trail. There is a complete absence ofmotive. No, my dear fellow; we must reconcile ourselves to thefact that we have no case at present, and that it is worth ourwhile to run any risk in order to establish one.""And how do you propose to do so?""I have great hopes of what Mrs. Laura Lyons may do for us whenthe position of affairs is made clear to her. And I have my ownplan as well. Sufficient for tomorrow is the evil thereof; but Ihope before the day is past to have the upper hand at last."I could draw nothing further from him, and he walked, lost inthought, as far as the Baskerville gates."Are you coming up?""Yes; I see no reason for further concealment. But one last word,Watson. Say nothing of the hound to Sir Henry. Let him think thatSelden's death was as Stapleton would have us believe. He willhave a better nerve for the ordeal which he will have to undergotomorrow, when he is engaged, if I remember your report aright,to dine with these people.""And so am I.""Then you must excuse yourself and he must go alone. That will beeasily arranged. And now, if we are too late for dinner, I thinkthat we are both ready for our suppers."Chapter 13.Fixing the NetsSir Henry was more pleased than surprised to see Sherlock Holmes,for he had for some days been expecting that recent events wouldbring him down from London. He did raise his eyebrows, however,when he found that my friend had neither any luggage nor anyexplanations for its absence. Between us we soon supplied hiswants, and then over a belated supper we explained to the baronetas much of our experience as it seemed desirable that he shouldknow. But first I had the unpleasant duty of breaking the news toBarrymore and his wife. To him it may have been an unmitigatedrelief, but she wept bitterly in her apron. To all the world hewas the man of violence, half animal and half demon; but to herhe always remained the little wilful boy of her own girlhood, thechild who had clung to her hand. Evil indeed is the man who hasnot one woman to mourn him."I've been moping in the house all day since Watson went off inthe morning," said the baronet. "I guess I should have somecredit, for I have kept my promise. If I hadn't sworn not to goabout alone I might have had a more lively evening, for I had amessage from Stapleton asking me over there.""I have no doubt that you would have had a more lively evening,"said Holmes drily. "By the way, I don't suppose you appreciatethat we have been mourning over you as having broken your neck?"Sir Henry opened his eyes. "How was that?""This poor wretch was dressed in your clothes. I fear yourservant who gave them to him may get into trouble with thepolice.""That is unlikely. There was no mark on any of them, as far as Iknow.""That's lucky for him-in fact, it's lucky for all of you, sinceyou are all on the wrong side of the law in this matter. I am notsure that as a conscientious detective my first duty is not toarrest the whole household. Watson's reports are mostincriminating documents.""But how about the case?" asked the baronet. "Have you madeanything out of the tangle? I don't know that Watson and I aremuch the wiser since we came down.""I think that I shall be in a position to make the situationrather more clear to you before long. It has been an exceedinglydifficult and most complicated business. There are several pointsupon which we still want light-but it is coming all the same.""We've had one experience, as Watson has no doubt told you. Weheard the hound on the moor, so I can swear that it is not allempty superstition. I had something to do with dogs when I wasout West, and I know one when I hear one. If you can muzzle thatone and put him on a chain I'll be ready to swear you are thegreatest detective of all time.""I think I will muzzle him and chain him all right if you willgive me your help.""Whatever you tell me to do I will do.""Very good; and I will ask you also to do it blindly, withoutalways asking the reason.""Just as you like.""If you will do this I think the chances are that our littleproblem will soon be solved. I have no doubt-"He stopped suddenly and stared fixedly up over my head into theair. The lamp beat upon his face, and so intent was it and sostill that it might have been that of a clear-cut classicalstatue, a personification of alertness and expectation."What is it?" we both cried.I could see as he looked down that he was repressing someinternal emotion. His features were still composed, but his eyesshone with amused exultation."Excuse the admiration of a connoisseur," said he as he waved hishand towards the line of portraits which covered the oppositewall. "Watson won't allow that I know anything of art but that ismere jealousy because our views upon the subject differ. Now,these are a really very fine series of portraits.""Well, I'm glad to hear you say so," said Sir Henry, glancingwith some surprise at my friend. "I don't pretend to know muchabout these things, and I'd be a better judge of a horse or asteer than of a picture. I didn't know that you found time forsuch things.""I know what is good when I see it, and I see it now. That's aKneller, I'll swear, that lady in the blue silk over yonder, andthe stout gentleman with the wig ought to be a Reynolds. They areall family portraits, I presume?""Every one.""Do you know the names?""Barrymore has been coaching me in them, and I think I can say mylessons fairly well.""Who is the gentleman with the telescope?""That is Rear-Admiral Baskerville, who served under Rodney in theWest Indies. The man with the blue coat and the roll of paper isSir William Baskerville, who was Chairman of Committees of theHouse of Commons under Pitt.""And this Cavalier opposite to me-the one with the black velvetand the lace?""Ah, you have a right to know about him. That is the cause of allthe mischief, the wicked Hugo, who started the Hound of theBaskervilles. We're not likely to forget him."I gazed with interest and some surprise upon the portrait."Dear me!" said Holmes, "he seems a quiet, meek-mannered manenough, but I dare say that there was a lurking devil in hiseyes. I had pictured him as a more robust and ruffianly person.""There's no doubt about the authenticity, for the name and thedate, 1647, are on the back of the canvas."Holmes said little more, but the picture of the old roystererseemed to have a fascination for him, and his eyes werecontinually fixed upon it during supper. It was not until later,when Sir Henry had gone to his room, that I was able to followthe trend of his thoughts. He led me back into thebanqueting-hall, his bedroom candle in his hand, and he held itup against the time-stained portrait on the wall."Do you see anything there?"I looked at the broad plumed hat, the curling love-locks, thewhite lace collar, and the straight, severe face which was framedbetween them. It was not a brutal countenance, but it was prim,hard, and stern, with a firm-set, thin-lipped mouth, and a coldlyintolerant eye."Is it like anyone you know?""There is something of Sir Henry about the jaw.""Just a suggestion, perhaps. But wait an instant!" He stood upona chair, and, holding up the light in his left hand, he curvedhis right arm over the broad hat and round the long ringlets."Good heavens!" I cried in amazement.The face of Stapleton had sprung out of the canvas."Ha, you see it now. My eyes have been trained to examine facesand not their trimmings. It is the first quality of a criminalinvestigator that he should see through a disguise.""But this is marvellous. It might be his portrait.""Yes, it is an interesting instance of a throwback, which appearsto be both physical and spiritual. A study of family portraits isenough to convert a man to the doctrine of reincarnation. Thefellow is a Baskerville-that is evident.""With designs upon the succession.""Exactly. This chance of the picture has supplied us with one ofour most obvious missing links. We have him, Watson, we have him,and I dare swear that before tomorrow night he will be flutteringin our net as helpless as one of his own butterflies. A pin, acork, and a card, and we add him to the Baker Street collection!"He burst into one of his rare fits of laughter as he turned awayfrom the picture. I have not heard him laugh often, and it hasalways boded ill to somebody.I was up betimes in the morning, but Holmes was afoot earlierstill, for I saw him as I dressed, coming up the drive."Yes, we should have a full day today," he remarked, and herubbed his hands with the joy of action. "The nets are all inplace, and the drag is about to begin. We'll know before the dayis out whether we have caught our big, lean-jawed pike, orwhether he has got through the meshes.""Have you been on the moor already?""I have sent a report from Grimpen to Princetown as to the deathof Selden. I think I can promise that none of you will betroubled in the matter. And I have also communicated with myfaithful Cartwright, who would certainly have pined away at thedoor of my hut, as a dog does at his master's grave, if I had notset his mind at rest about my safety.""What is the next move?""To see Sir Henry. Ah, here he is!""Good-morning, Holmes," said the baronet. "You look like ageneral who is planning a battle with his chief of the staff.""That is the exact situation. Watson was asking for orders.""And so do I.""Very good. You are engaged, as I understand, to dine with ourfriends the Stapletons tonight.""I hope that you will come also. They are very hospitable people,and I am sure that they would be very glad to see you.""I fear that Watson and I must go to London.""To London?""Yes, I think that we should be more useful there at the presentjuncture."The baronet's face perceptibly lengthened."I hoped that you were going to see me through this business. TheHall and the moor are not very pleasant places when one isalone.""My dear fellow, you must trust me implicitly and do exactly whatI tell you. You can tell your friends that we should have beenhappy to have come with you, but that urgent business required usto be in town. We hope very soon to return to Devonshire. Willyou remember to give them that message?""If you insist upon it.""There is no alternative, I assure you."I saw by the baronet's clouded brow that he was deeply hurt bywhat he regarded as our desertion."When do you desire to go?" he asked coldly."Immediately after breakfast. We will drive in to Coombe Tracey,but Watson will leave his things as a pledge that he will comeback to you. Watson, you will send a note to Stapleton to tellhim that you regret that you cannot come.""I have a good mind to go to London with you," said the baronet."Why should I stay here alone?""Because it is your post of duty. Because you gave me your wordthat you would do as you were told, and I tell you to stay.""All right, then, I'll stay.""One more direction! I wish you to drive to Merripit House. Sendback your trap, however, and let them know that you intend towalk home.""To walk across the moor?""Yes.""But that is the very thing which you have so often cautioned menot to do.""This time you may do it with safety. If I had not everyconfidence in your nerve and courage I would not suggest it, butit is essential that you should do it.""Then I will do it.""And as you value your life do not go across the moor in anydirection save along the straight path which leads from MerripitHouse to the Grimpen Road, and is your natural way home.""I will do just what you say.""Very good. I should be glad to get away as soon after breakfastas possible, so as to reach London in the afternoon."I was much astounded by this programme, though I remembered thatHolmes had said to Stapleton on the night before that his visitwould terminate next day. It had not crossed my mind however,that he would wish me to go with him, nor could I understand howwe could both be absent at a moment which he himself declared tobe critical. There was nothing for it, however, but implicitobedience; so we bade good-bye to our rueful friend, and a coupleof hours afterwards we were at the station of Coombe Tracey andhad dispatched the trap upon its return journey. A small boy waswaiting upon the platform."Any orders, sir?""You will take this train to town, Cartwright. The moment youarrive you will send a wire to Sir Henry Baskerville, in my name,to say that if he finds the pocketbook which I have dropped he isto send it by registered post to Baker Street.""Yes, sir.""And ask at the station office if there is a message for me."The boy returned with a telegram, which Holmes handed to me. Itran:Wire received. Coming down with unsigned warrant. Arrivefive-forty. Lestrade."That is in answer to mine of this morning. He is the best of theprofessionals, I think, and we may need his assistance. Now,Watson, I think that we cannot employ our time better than bycalling upon your acquaintance, Mrs. Laura Lyons."His plan of campaign was beginning to be evident. He would usethe baronet in order to convince the Stapletons that we werereally gone, while we should actually return at the instant whenwe were likely to be needed. That telegram from London, ifmentioned by Sir Henry to the Stapletons, must remove the lastsuspicions from their minds. Already I seemed to see our netsdrawing closer around that lean-jawed pike.Mrs. Laura Lyons was in her office, and Sherlock Holmes openedhis interview with a frankness and directness which considerablyamazed her."I am investigating the circumstances which attended the death ofthe late Sir Charles Baskerville," said he. "My friend here, Dr.Watson, has informed me of what you have communicated, and alsoof what you have withheld in connection with that matter.""What have I withheld?" she asked defiantly."You have confessed that you asked Sir Charles to be at the gateat ten o'clock. We know that that was the place and hour of hisdeath. You have withheld what the connection is between theseevents.""There is no connection.""In that case the coincidence must indeed be an extraordinaryone. But I think that we shall succeed in establishing aconnection, after all. I wish to be perfectly frank with you,Mrs. Lyons. We regard this case as one of murder, and theevidence may implicate not only your friend Mr. Stapleton but hiswife as well."The lady sprang from her chair."His wife!" she cried."The fact is no longer a secret. The person who has passed forhis sister is really his wife."Mrs. Lyons had resumed her seat. Her hands were grasping the armsof her chair, and I saw that the pink nails had turned white withthe pressure of her grip."His wife!" she said again. "His wife! He is not a married man."Sherlock Holmes shrugged his shoulders."Prove it to me! Prove it to me! And if you can do so-!"The fierce flash of her eyes said more than any words."I have come prepared to do so," said Holmes, drawing severalpapers from his pocket. "Here is a photograph of the couple takenin York four years ago. It is indorsed 'Mr. and Mrs. Vandeleur,'but you will have no difficulty in recognizing him, and her also,if you know her by sight. Here are three written descriptions bytrustworthy witnesses of Mr. and Mrs. Vandeleur, who at that timekept St. Oliver's private school. Read them and see if you candoubt the identity of these people."She glanced at them, and then looked up at us with the set, rigidface of a desperate woman."Mr. Holmes," she said, "this man had offered me marriage oncondition that I could get a divorce from my husband. He has liedto me, the villain, in every conceivable way. Not one word oftruth has he ever told me. And why-why? I imagined that all wasfor my own sake. But now I see that I was never anything but atool in his hands. Why should I preserve faith with him who neverkept any with me? Why should I try to shield him from theconsequences of his own wicked acts? Ask me what you like, andthere is nothing which I shall hold back. One thing I swear toyou, and that is that when I wrote the letter I never dreamed ofany harm to the old gentleman, who had been my kindest friend.""I entirely believe you, madam," said Sherlock Holmes. "Therecital of these events must be very painful to you, and perhapsit will make it easier if I tell you what occurred, and you cancheck me if I make any material mistake. The sending of thisletter was suggested to you by Stapleton?""He dictated it.""I presume that the reason he gave was that you would receivehelp from Sir Charles for the legal expenses connected with yourdivorce?""Exactly.""And then after you had sent the letter he dissuaded you fromkeeping the appointment?""He told me that it would hurt his self-respect that any otherman should find the money for such an object, and that though hewas a poor man himself he would devote his last penny to removingthe obstacles which divided us.""He appears to be a very consistent character. And then you heardnothing until you read the reports of the death in the paper?""No.""And he made you swear to say nothing about your appointment withSir Charles?""He did. He said that the death was a very mysterious one, andthat I should certainly be suspected if the facts came out. Hefrightened me into remaining silent.""Quite so. But you had your suspicions?"She hesitated and looked down."I knew him," she said. "But if he had kept faith with me Ishould always have done so with him.""I think that on the whole you have had a fortunate escape," saidSherlock Holmes. "You have had him in your power and he knew it,and yet you are alive. You have been walking for some months verynear to the edge of a precipice. We must wish you good-morningnow, Mrs. Lyons, and it is probable that you will very shortlyhear from us again.""Our case becomes rounded off, and difficulty after difficultythins away in front of us," said Holmes as we stood waiting forthe arrival of the express from town. "I shall soon be in theposition of being able to put into a single connected narrativeone of the most singular and sensational crimes of modern times.Students of criminology will remember the analogous incidents inGodno, in Little Russia, in the year '66, and of course there arethe Anderson murders in North Carolina, but this case possessessome features which are entirely its own. Even now we have noclear case against this very wily man. But I shall be very muchsurprised if it is not clear enough before we go to bed thisnight."The London express came roaring into the station, and a small,wiry bulldog of a man had sprung from a first-class carriage. Weall three shook hands, and I saw at once from the reverential wayin which Lestrade gazed at my companion that he had learned agood deal since the days when they had first worked together. Icould well remember the scorn which the theories of the reasonerused then to excite in the practical man."Anything good?" he asked."The biggest thing for years," said Holmes. "We have two hoursbefore we need think of starting. I think we might employ it ingetting some dinner and then, Lestrade, we will take the Londonfog out of your throat by giving you a breath of the pure nightair of Dartmoor. Never been there? Ah, well, I don't suppose youwill forget your first visit."Chapter 14.The Hound of the BaskervillesOne of Sherlock Holmes's defects-if, indeed, one may call it adefect-was that he was exceedingly loath to communicate his fullplans to any other person until the instant of their fulfilment.Partly it came no doubt from his own masterful nature, whichloved to dominate and surprise those who were around him. Partlyalso from his professional caution, which urged him never to takeany chances. The result, however, was very trying for those whowere acting as his agents and assistants. I had often sufferedunder it, but never more so than during that long drive in thedarkness. The great ordeal was in front of us; at last we wereabout to make our final effort, and yet Holmes had said nothing,and I could only surmise what his course of action would be. Mynerves thrilled with anticipation when at last the cold wind uponour faces and the dark, void spaces on either side of the narrowroad told me that we were back upon the moor once again. Everystride of the horses and every turn of the wheels was taking usnearer to our supreme adventure.Our conversation was hampered by the presence of the driver ofthe hired wagonette, so that we were forced to talk of trivialmatters when our nerves were tense with emotion and anticipation.It was a relief to me, after that unnatural restraint, when we atlast passed Frankland's house and knew that we were drawing nearto the Hall and to the scene of action. We did not drive up tothe door but got down near the gate of the avenue. The wagonettewas paid off and ordered to return to Coombe Tracey forthwith,while we started to walk to Merripit House."Are you armed, Lestrade?"The little detective smiled. "As long as I have my trousers Ihave a hip-pocket, and as long as I have my hip-pocket I havesomething in it.""Good! My friend and I are also ready for emergencies.""You're mighty close about this affair, Mr. Holmes. What's thegame now?""A waiting game.""My word, it does not seem a very cheerful place," said thedetective with a shiver, glancing round him at the gloomy slopesof the hill and at the huge lake of fog which lay over theGrimpen Mire. "I see the lights of a house ahead of us.""That is Merripit House and the end of our journey. I mustrequest you to walk on tiptoe and not to talk above a whisper."We moved cautiously along the track as if we were bound for thehouse, but Holmes halted us when we were about two hundred yardsfrom it."This will do," said he. "These rocks upon the right make anadmirable screen.""We are to wait here?""Yes, we shall make our little ambush here. Get into this hollow,Lestrade. You have been inside the house, have you not, Watson?Can you tell the position of the rooms? What are those latticedwindows at this end?""I think they are the kitchen windows.""And the one beyond, which shines so brightly?""That is certainly the dining-room.""The blinds are up. You know the lie of the land best. Creepforward quietly and see what they are doing-but for heaven's sakedon't let them know that they are watched!"I tiptoed down the path and stooped behind the low wall whichsurrounded the stunted orchard. Creeping in its shadow I reacheda point whence I could look straight through the uncurtainedwindow.There were only two men in the room, Sir Henry and Stapleton.They sat with their profiles towards me on either side of theround table. Both of them were smoking cigars, and coffee andwine were in front of them. Stapleton was talking with animation,but the baronet looked pale and distrait. Perhaps the thought ofthat lonely walk across the ill-omened moor was weighing heavilyupon his mind.As I watched them Stapleton rose and left the room, while SirHenry filled his glass again and leaned back in his chair,puffing at his cigar. I heard the creak of a door and the crispsound of boots upon gravel. The steps passed along the path onthe other side of the wall under which I crouched. Looking over,I saw the naturalist pause at the door of an out-house in thecorner of the orchard. A key turned in a lock, and as he passedin there was a curious scuffling noise from within. He was only aminute or so inside, and then I heard the key turn once more andhe passed me and reentered the house. I saw him rejoin his guest,and I crept quietly back to where my companions were waiting totell them what I had seen."You say, Watson, that the lady is not there?" Holmes asked whenI had finished my report."No.""Where can she be, then, since there is no light in any otherroom except the kitchen?""I cannot think where she is."I have said that over the great Grimpen Mire there hung a dense,white fog. It was drifting slowly in our direction and bankeditself up like a wall on that side of us, low but thick and welldefined. The moon shone on it, and it looked like a greatshimmering ice-field, with the heads of the distant tors as rocksborne upon its surface. Holmes's face was turned towards it, andhe muttered impatiently as he watched its sluggish drift."It's moving towards us, Watson.""Is that serious?""Very serious, indeed-the one thing upon earth which could havedisarranged my plans. He can't be very long, now. It is alreadyten o'clock. Our success and even his life may depend upon hiscoming out before the fog is over the path."The night was clear and fine above us. The stars shone cold andbright, while a half-moon bathed the whole scene in a soft,uncertain light. Before us lay the dark bulk of the house, itsserrated roof and bristling chimneys hard outlined against thesilver-spangled sky. Broad bars of golden light from the lowerwindows stretched across the orchard and the moor. One of themwas suddenly shut off. The servants had left the kitchen. Thereonly remained the lamp in the dining-room where the two men, themurderous host and the unconscious guest, still chatted overtheir cigars.Every minute that white woolly plain which covered one-half ofthe moor was drifting closer and closer to the house. Already thefirst thin wisps of it were curling across the golden square ofthe lighted window. The farther wall of the orchard was alreadyinvisible, and the trees were standing out of a swirl of whitevapour. As we watched it the fog-wreaths came crawling round bothcorners of the house and rolled slowly into one dense bank onwhich the upper floor and the roof floated like a strange shipupon a shadowy sea. Holmes struck his hand passionately upon therock in front of us and stamped his feet in his impatience."If he isn't out in a quarter of an hour the path will becovered. In half an hour we won't be able to see our hands infront of us.""Shall we move farther back upon higher ground?""Yes, I think it would be as well."So as the fog-bank flowed onward we fell back before it until wewere half a mile from the house, and still that dense white sea,with the moon silvering its upper edge, swept slowly andinexorably on."We are going too far," said Holmes. "We dare not take the chanceof his being overtaken before he can reach us. At all costs wemust hold our ground where we are." He dropped on his knees andclapped his ear to the ground. "Thank God, I think that I hearhim coming."A sound of quick steps broke the silence of the moor. Crouchingamong the stones we stared intently at the silver-tipped bank infront of us. The steps grew louder, and through the fog, asthrough a curtain, there stepped the man whom we were awaiting.He looked round him in surprise as he emerged into the clear,starlit night. Then he came swiftly along the path, passed closeto where we lay, and went on up the long slope behind us. As hewalked he glanced continually over either shoulder, like a manwho is ill at ease."Hist!" cried Holmes, and I heard the sharp click of a cockingpistol. "Look out! It's coming!"There was a thin, crisp, continuous patter from somewhere in theheart of that crawling bank. The cloud was within fifty yards ofwhere we lay, and we glared at it, all three, uncertain whathorror was about to break from the heart of it. I was at Holmes'selbow, and I glanced for an instant at his face. It was pale andexultant, his eyes shining brightly in the moonlight. Butsuddenly they started forward in a rigid, fixed stare, and hislips parted in amazement. At the same instant Lestrade gave ayell of terror and threw himself face downward upon the ground. Isprang to my feet, my inert hand grasping my pistol, my mindparalyzed by the dreadful shape which had sprung out upon us fromthe shadows of the fog. A hound it was, an enormous coal-blackhound, but not such a hound as mortal eyes have ever seen. Fireburst from its open mouth, its eyes glowed with a smoulderingglare, its muzzle and hackles and dewlap were outlined inflickering flame. Never in the delirious dream of a disorderedbrain could anything more savage, more appalling, more hellish beconceived than that dark form and savage face which broke upon usout of the wall of fog.With long bounds the huge black creature was leaping down thetrack, following hard upon the footsteps of our friend. Soparalyzed were we by the apparition that we allowed him to passbefore we had recovered our nerve. Then Holmes and I both firedtogether, and the creature gave a hideous howl, which showed thatone at least had hit him. He did not pause, however, but boundedonward. Far away on the path we saw Sir Henry looking back, hisface white in the moonlight, his hands raised in horror, glaringhelplessly at the frightful thing which was hunting him down. Butthat cry of pain from the hound had blown all our fears to thewinds. If he was vulnerable he was mortal, and if we could woundhim we could kill him. Never have I seen a man run as Holmes ranthat night. I am reckoned fleet of foot, but he outpaced me asmuch as I outpaced the little professional. In front of us as weflew up the track we heard scream after scream from Sir Henry andthe deep roar of the hound. I was in time to see the beast springupon its victim, hurl him to the ground, and worry at his throat.But the next instant Holmes had emptied five barrels of hisrevolver into the creature's flank. With a last howl of agony anda vicious snap in the air, it rolled upon its back, four feetpawing furiously, and then fell limp upon its side. I stooped,panting, and pressed my pistol to the dreadful, shimmering head,but it was useless to press the trigger. The giant hound wasdead.Sir Henry lay insensible where he had fallen. We tore away hiscollar, and Holmes breathed a prayer of gratitude when we sawthat there was no sign of a wound and that the rescue had been intime. Already our friend's eyelids shivered and he made a feebleeffort to move. Lestrade thrust his brandy-flask between thebaronet's teeth, and two frightened eyes were looking up at us."My God!" he whispered. "What was it? What, in heaven's name, wasit?""It's dead, whatever it is," said Holmes. "We've laid the familyghost once and forever."In mere size and strength it was a terrible creature which waslying stretched before us. It was not a pure bloodhound and itwas not a pure mastiff; but it appeared to be a combination ofthe two-gaunt, savage, and as large as a small lioness. Even nowin the stillness of death, the huge jaws seemed to be drippingwith a bluish flame and the small, deep-set, cruel eyes wereringed with fire. I placed my hand upon the glowing muzzle, andas I held them up my own fingers smouldered and gleamed in thedarkness."Phosphorus," I said."A cunning preparation of it," said Holmes, sniffing at the deadanimal. "There is no smell which might have interfered with hispower of scent. We owe you a deep apology, Sir Henry, for havingexposed you to this fright. I was prepared for a hound, but notfor such a creature as this. And the fog gave us little time toreceive him.""You have saved my life.""Having first endangered it. Are you strong enough to stand?""Give me another mouthful of that brandy and I shall be ready foranything. So! Now, if you will help me up. What do you propose todo?""To leave you here. You are not fit for further adventurestonight. If you will wait, one or other of us will go back withyou to the Hall."He tried to stagger to his feet; but he was still ghastly paleand trembling in every limb. We helped him to a rock, where hesat shivering with his face buried in his hands."We must leave you now," said Holmes. "The rest of our work mustbe done, and every moment is of importance. We have our case, andnow we only want our man."It's a thousand to one against our finding him at the house," hecontinued as we retraced our steps swiftly down the path. "Thoseshots must have told him that the game was up.""We were some distance off, and this fog may have deadened them.""He followed the hound to call him off-of that you may becertain. No, no, he's gone by this time! But we'll search thehouse and make sure."The front door was open, so we rushed in and hurried from room toroom to the amazement of a doddering old manservant, who met usin the passage. There was no light save in the dining-room, butHolmes caught up the lamp and left no corner of the houseunexplored. No sign could we see of the man whom we were chasing.On the upper floor, however, one of the bedroom doors was locked."There's someone in here," cried Lestrade. "I can hear amovement. Open this door!"A faint moaning and rustling came from within. Holmes struck thedoor just over the lock with the flat of his foot and it flewopen. Pistol in hand, we all three rushed into the room.But there was no sign within it of that desperate and defiantvillain whom we expected to see. Instead we were faced by anobject so strange and so unexpected that we stood for a momentstaring at it in amazement.The room had been fashioned into a small museum, and the wallswere lined by a number of glass-topped cases full of thatcollection of butterflies and moths the formation of which hadbeen the relaxation of this complex and dangerous man. In thecentre of this room there was an upright beam, which had beenplaced at some period as a support for the old worm-eaten baulkof timber which spanned the roof. To this post a figure was tied,so swathed and muffled in the sheets which had been used tosecure it that one could not for the moment tell whether it wasthat of a man or a woman. One towel passed round the throat andwas secured at the back of the pillar. Another covered the lowerpart of the face, and over it two dark eyes-eyes full of griefand shame and a dreadful questioning-stared back at us. In aminute we had torn off the gag, unswathed the bonds, and Mrs.Stapleton sank upon the floor in front of us. As her beautifulhead fell upon her chest I saw the clear red weal of a whiplashacross her neck."The brute!" cried Holmes. "Here, Lestrade, your brandy-bottle!Put her in the chair! She has fainted from ill-usage andexhaustion."She opened her eyes again."Is he safe?" she asked. "Has he escaped?""He cannot escape us, madam.""No, no, I did not mean my husband. Sir Henry? Is he safe?""Yes.""And the hound?""It is dead."She gave a long sigh of satisfaction."Thank God! Thank God! Oh, this villain! See how he has treatedme!" She shot her arms out from her sleeves, and we saw withhorror that they were all mottled with bruises. "But this isnothing-nothing! It is my mind and soul that he has tortured anddefiled. I could endure it all, ill-usage, solitude, a life ofdeception, everything, as long as I could still cling to the hopethat I had his love, but now I know that in this also I have beenhis dupe and his tool." She broke into passionate sobbing as shespoke."You bear him no good will, madam," said Holmes. "Tell us thenwhere we shall find him. If you have ever aided him in evil, helpus now and so atone.""There is but one place where he can have fled," she answered."There is an old tin mine on an island in the heart of the mire.It was there that he kept his hound and there also he had madepreparations so that he might have a refuge. That is where hewould fly."The fog-bank lay like white wool against the window. Holmes heldthe lamp towards it."See," said he. "No one could find his way into the Grimpen Miretonight."She laughed and clapped her hands. Her eyes and teeth gleamedwith fierce merriment."He may find his way in, but never out," she cried. "How can hesee the guiding wands tonight? We planted them together, he andI, to mark the pathway through the mire. Oh, if I could only haveplucked them out today. Then indeed you would have had him atyour mercy!"It was evident to us that all pursuit was in vain until the foghad lifted. Meanwhile we left Lestrade in possession of the housewhile Holmes and I went back with the baronet to BaskervilleHall. The story of the Stapletons could no longer be withheldfrom him, but he took the blow bravely when he learned the truthabout the woman whom he had loved. But the shock of the night'sadventures had shattered his nerves, and before morning he laydelirious in a high fever under the care of Dr. Mortimer. The twoof them were destined to travel together round the world beforeSir Henry had become once more the hale, hearty man that he hadbeen before he became master of that ill-omened estate.And now I come rapidly to the conclusion of this singularnarrative, in which I have tried to make the reader share thosedark fears and vague surmises which clouded our lives so long andended in so tragic a manner. On the morning after the death ofthe hound the fog had lifted and we were guided by Mrs. Stapletonto the point where they had found a pathway through the bog. Ithelped us to realise the horror of this woman's life when we sawthe eagerness and joy with which she laid us on her husband'strack. We left her standing upon the thin peninsula of firm,peaty soil which tapered out into the widespread bog. From theend of it a small wand planted here and there showed where thepath zigzagged from tuft to tuft of rushes among thosegreen-scummed pits and foul quagmires which barred the way to thestranger. Rank reeds and lush, slimy water-plants sent an odourof decay and a heavy miasmatic vapour onto our faces, while afalse step plunged us more than once thigh-deep into the dark,quivering mire, which shook for yards in soft undulations aroundour feet. Its tenacious grip plucked at our heels as we walked,and when we sank into it it was as if some malignant hand wastugging us down into those obscene depths, so grim and purposefulwas the clutch in which it held us. Once only we saw a trace thatsomeone had passed that perilous way before us. From amid a tuftof cotton grass which bore it up out of the slime some dark thingwas projecting. Holmes sank to his waist as he stepped from thepath to seize it, and had we not been there to drag him out hecould never have set his foot upon firm land again. He held anold black boot in the air. "Meyers, Toronto," was printed on theleather inside."It is worth a mud bath," said he. "It is our friend Sir Henry'smissing boot.""Thrown there by Stapleton in his flight.""Exactly. He retained it in his hand after using it to set thehound upon the track. He fled when he knew the game was up, stillclutching it. And he hurled it away at this point of his flight.We know at least that he came so far in safety."But more than that we were never destined to know, though therewas much which we might surmise. There was no chance of findingfootsteps in the mire, for the rising mud oozed swiftly in uponthem, but as we at last reached firmer ground beyond the morasswe all looked eagerly for them. But no slightest sign of themever met our eyes. If the earth told a true story, then Stapletonnever reached that island of refuge towards which he struggledthrough the fog upon that last night. Somewhere in the heart ofthe great Grimpen Mire, down in the foul slime of the huge morasswhich had sucked him in, this cold and cruel-hearted man isforever buried.Many traces we found of him in the bog-girt island where he hadhid his savage ally. A huge driving-wheel and a shaft half-filledwith rubbish showed the position of an abandoned mine. Beside itwere the crumbling remains of the cottages of the miners, drivenaway no doubt by the foul reek of the surrounding swamp. In oneof these a staple and chain with a quantity of gnawed bonesshowed where the animal had been confined. A skeleton with atangle of brown hair adhering to it lay among the _debris_."A dog!" said Holmes. "By Jove, a curly-haired spaniel. PoorMortimer will never see his pet again. Well, I do not know thatthis place contains any secret which we have not alreadyfathomed. He could hide his hound, but he could not hush itsvoice, and hence came those cries which even in daylight were notpleasant to hear. On an emergency he could keep the hound in theout-house at Merripit, but it was always a risk, and it was onlyon the supreme day, which he regarded as the end of all hisefforts, that he dared do it. This paste in the tin is no doubtthe luminous mixture with which the creature was daubed. It wassuggested, of course, by the story of the family hell-hound, andby the desire to frighten old Sir Charles to death. No wonder thepoor devil of a convict ran and screamed, even as our friend did,and as we ourselves might have done, when he saw such a creaturebounding through the darkness of the moor upon his track. It wasa cunning device, for, apart from the chance of driving yourvictim to his death, what peasant would venture to inquire tooclosely into such a creature should he get sight of it, as manyhave done, upon the moor? I said it in London, Watson, and I sayit again now, that never yet have we helped to hunt down a moredangerous man than he who is lying yonder"-he swept his long armtowards the huge mottled expanse of green-splotched bog whichstretched away until it merged into the russet slopes of themoor.Chapter 15.A RetrospectionIt was the end of November, and Holmes and I sat, upon a raw andfoggy night, on either side of a blazing fire in our sitting-roomin Baker Street. Since the tragic upshot of our visit toDevonshire he had been engaged in two affairs of the utmostimportance, in the first of which he had exposed the atrociousconduct of Colonel Upwood in connection with the famous cardscandal of the Nonpareil Club, while in the second he haddefended the unfortunate Mme. Montpensier from the charge ofmurder which hung over her in connection with the death of herstep-daughter, Mlle. Carere, the young lady who, as it will beremembered, was found six months later alive and married in NewYork. My friend was in excellent spirits over the success whichhad attended a succession of difficult and important cases, sothat I was able to induce him to discuss the details of theBaskerville mystery. I had waited patiently for the opportunityfor I was aware that he would never permit cases to overlap, andthat his clear and logical mind would not be drawn from itspresent work to dwell upon memories of the past. Sir Henry andDr. Mortimer were, however, in London, on their way to that longvoyage which had been recommended for the restoration of hisshattered nerves. They had called upon us that very afternoon, sothat it was natural that the subject should come up fordiscussion."The whole course of events," said Holmes, "from the point ofview of the man who called himself Stapleton was simple anddirect, although to us, who had no means in the beginning ofknowing the motives of his actions and could only learn part ofthe facts, it all appeared exceedingly complex. I have had theadvantage of two conversations with Mrs. Stapleton, and the casehas now been so entirely cleared up that I am not aware thatthere is anything which has remained a secret to us. You willfind a few notes upon the matter under the heading B in myindexed list of cases.""Perhaps you would kindly give me a sketch of the course ofevents from memory.""Certainly, though I cannot guarantee that I carry all the factsin my mind. Intense mental concentration has a curious way ofblotting out what has passed. The barrister who has his case athis fingers' ends and is able to argue with an expert upon hisown subject finds that a week or two of the courts will drive itall out of his head once more. So each of my cases displaces thelast, and Mlle. Carere has blurred my recollection of BaskervilleHall. Tomorrow some other little problem may be submitted to mynotice which will in turn dispossess the fair French lady and theinfamous Upwood. So far as the case of the hound goes, however, Iwill give you the course of events as nearly as I can, and youwill suggest anything which I may have forgotten."My inquiries show beyond all question that the family portraitdid not lie, and that this fellow was indeed a Baskerville. Hewas a son of that Rodger Baskerville, the younger brother of SirCharles, who fled with a sinister reputation to South America,where he was said to have died unmarried. He did, as a matter offact, marry, and had one child, this fellow, whose real name isthe same as his father's. He married Beryl Garcia, one of thebeauties of Costa Rica, and, having purloined a considerable sumof public money, he changed his name to Vandeleur and fled toEngland, where he established a school in the east of Yorkshire.His reason for attempting this special line of business was thathe had struck up an acquaintance with a consumptive tutor uponthe voyage home, and that he had used this man's ability to makethe undertaking a success. Fraser, the tutor, died however, andthe school which had begun well sank from disrepute into infamy.The Vandeleurs found it convenient to change their name toStapleton, and he brought the remains of his fortune, his schemesfor the future, and his taste for entomology to the south ofEngland. I learned at the British Museum that he was a recognizedauthority upon the subject, and that the name of Vandeleur hasbeen permanently attached to a certain moth which he had, in hisYorkshire days, been the first to describe."We now come to that portion of his life which has proved to beof such intense interest to us. The fellow had evidently madeinquiry and found that only two lives intervened between him anda valuable estate. When he went to Devonshire his plans were, Ibelieve, exceedingly hazy, but that he meant mischief from thefirst is evident from the way in which he took his wife with himin the character of his sister. The idea of using her as a decoywas clearly already in his mind, though he may not have beencertain how the details of his plot were to be arranged. He meantin the end to have the estate, and he was ready to use any toolor run any risk for that end. His first act was to establishhimself as near to his ancestral home as he could, and his secondwas to cultivate a friendship with Sir Charles Baskerville andwith the neighbours."The baronet himself told him about the family hound, and soprepared the way for his own death. Stapleton, as I will continueto call him, knew that the old man's heart was weak and that ashock would kill him. So much he had learned from Dr. Mortimer.He had heard also that Sir Charles was superstitious and hadtaken this grim legend very seriously. His ingenious mindinstantly suggested a way by which the baronet could be done todeath, and yet it would be hardly possible to bring home theguilt to the real murderer."Having conceived the idea he proceeded to carry it out withconsiderable finesse. An ordinary schemer would have been contentto work with a savage hound. The use of artificial means to makethe creature diabolical was a flash of genius upon his part. Thedog he bought in London from Ross and Mangles, the dealers inFulham Road. It was the strongest and most savage in theirpossession. He brought it down by the North Devon line and walkeda great distance over the moor so as to get it home withoutexciting any remarks. He had already on his insect hunts learnedto penetrate the Grimpen Mire, and so had found a safehiding-place for the creature. Here he kennelled it and waitedhis chance."But it was some time coming. The old gentleman could not bedecoyed outside of his grounds at night. Several times Stapletonlurked about with his hound, but without avail. It was duringthese fruitless quests that he, or rather his ally, was seen bypeasants, and that the legend of the demon dog received a newconfirmation. He had hoped that his wife might lure Sir Charlesto his ruin, but here she proved unexpectedly independent. Shewould not endeavour to entangle the old gentleman in asentimental attachment which might deliver him over to his enemy.Threats and even, I am sorry to say, blows refused to move her.She would have nothing to do with it, and for a time Stapletonwas at a deadlock."He found a way out of his difficulties through the chance thatSir Charles, who had conceived a friendship for him, made him theminister of his charity in the case of this unfortunate woman,Mrs. Laura Lyons. By representing himself as a single man heacquired complete influence over her, and he gave her tounderstand that in the event of her obtaining a divorce from herhusband he would marry her. His plans were suddenly brought to ahead by his knowledge that Sir Charles was about to leave theHall on the advice of Dr. Mortimer, with whose opinion he himselfpretended to coincide. He must act at once, or his victim mightget beyond his power. He therefore put pressure upon Mrs. Lyonsto write this letter, imploring the old man to give her aninterview on the evening before his departure for London. Hethen, by a specious argument, prevented her from going, and sohad the chance for which he had waited."Driving back in the evening from Coombe Tracey he was in time toget his hound, to treat it with his infernal paint, and to bringthe beast round to the gate at which he had reason to expect thathe would find the old gentleman waiting. The dog, incited by itsmaster, sprang over the wicket-gate and pursued the unfortunatebaronet, who fled screaming down the yew alley. In that gloomytunnel it must indeed have been a dreadful sight to see that hugeblack creature, with its flaming jaws and blazing eyes, boundingafter its victim. He fell dead at the end of the alley from heartdisease and terror. The hound had kept upon the grassy borderwhile the baronet had run down the path, so that no track but theman's was visible. On seeing him lying still the creature hadprobably approached to sniff at him, but finding him dead hadturned away again. It was then that it left the print which wasactually observed by Dr. Mortimer. The hound was called off andhurried away to its lair in the Grimpen Mire, and a mystery wasleft which puzzled the authorities, alarmed the countryside, andfinally brought the case within the scope of our observation."So much for the death of Sir Charles Baskerville. You perceivethe devilish cunning of it, for really it would be almostimpossible to make a case against the real murderer. His onlyaccomplice was one who could never give him away, and thegrotesque, inconceivable nature of the device only served to makeit more effective. Both of the women concerned in the case, Mrs.Stapleton and Mrs. Laura Lyons, were left with a strong suspicionagainst Stapleton. Mrs. Stapleton knew that he had designs uponthe old man, and also of the existence of the hound. Mrs. Lyonsknew neither of these things, but had been impressed by the deathoccurring at the time of an uncancelled appointment which wasonly known to him. However, both of them were under hisinfluence, and he had nothing to fear from them. The first halfof his task was successfully accomplished but the more difficultstill remained."It is possible that Stapleton did not know of the existence ofan heir in Canada. In any case he would very soon learn it fromhis friend Dr. Mortimer, and he was told by the latter alldetails about the arrival of Henry Baskerville. Stapleton's firstidea was that this young stranger from Canada might possibly bedone to death in London without coming down to Devonshire at all.He distrusted his wife ever since she had refused to help him inlaying a trap for the old man, and he dared not leave her longout of his sight for fear he should lose his influence over her.It was for this reason that he took her to London with him. Theylodged, I find, at the Mexborough Private Hotel, in CravenStreet, which was actually one of those called upon by my agentin search of evidence. Here he kept his wife imprisoned in herroom while he, disguised in a beard, followed Dr. Mortimer toBaker Street and afterwards to the station and to theNorthumberland Hotel. His wife had some inkling of his plans; butshe had such a fear of her husband-a fear founded upon brutalill-treatment-that she dare not write to warn the man whom sheknew to be in danger. If the letter should fall into Stapleton'shands her own life would not be safe. Eventually, as we know, sheadopted the expedient of cutting out the words which would formthe message, and addressing the letter in a disguised hand. Itreached the baronet, and gave him the first warning of hisdanger."It was very essential for Stapleton to get some article of SirHenry's attire so that, in case he was driven to use the dog, hemight always have the means of setting him upon his track. Withcharacteristic promptness and audacity he set about this at once,and we cannot doubt that the boots or chamber-maid of the hotelwas well bribed to help him in his design. By chance, however,the first boot which was procured for him was a new one and,therefore, useless for his purpose. He then had it returned andobtained another-a most instructive incident, since it provedconclusively to my mind that we were dealing with a real hound,as no other supposition could explain this anxiety to obtain anold boot and this indifference to a new one. The more _outre_ andgrotesque an incident is the more carefully it deserves to beexamined, and the very point which appears to complicate a caseis, when duly considered and scientifically handled, the onewhich is most likely to elucidate it."Then we had the visit from our friends next morning, shadowedalways by Stapleton in the cab. From his knowledge of our roomsand of my appearance, as well as from his general conduct, I aminclined to think that Stapleton's career of crime has been by nomeans limited to this single Baskerville affair. It is suggestivethat during the last three years there have been fourconsiderable burglaries in the west country, for none of whichwas any criminal ever arrested. The last of these, at FolkestoneCourt, in May, was remarkable for the cold-blooded pistolling ofthe page, who surprised the masked and solitary burglar. I cannotdoubt that Stapleton recruited his waning resources in thisfashion, and that for years he has been a desperate and dangerousman."We had an example of his readiness of resource that morning whenhe got away from us so successfully, and also of his audacity insending back my own name to me through the cabman. From thatmoment he understood that I had taken over the case in London,and that therefore there was no chance for him there. He returnedto Dartmoor and awaited the arrival of the baronet.""One moment!" said I. "You have, no doubt, described the sequenceof events correctly, but there is one point which you have leftunexplained. What became of the hound when its master was inLondon?""I have given some attention to this matter and it is undoubtedlyof importance. There can be no question that Stapleton had aconfidant, though it is unlikely that he ever placed himself inhis power by sharing all his plans with him. There was an oldmanservant at Merripit House, whose name was Anthony. Hisconnection with the Stapletons can be traced for several years,as far back as the school-mastering days, so that he must havebeen aware that his master and mistress were really husband andwife. This man has disappeared and has escaped from the country.It is suggestive that Anthony is not a common name in England,while Antonio is so in all Spanish or Spanish-American countries.The man, like Mrs. Stapleton herself, spoke good English, butwith a curious lisping accent. I have myself seen this old mancross the Grimpen Mire by the path which Stapleton had markedout. It is very probable, therefore, that in the absence of hismaster it was he who cared for the hound, though he may neverhave known the purpose for which the beast was used."The Stapletons then went down to Devonshire, whither they weresoon followed by Sir Henry and you. One word now as to how Istood myself at that time. It may possibly recur to your memorythat when I examined the paper upon which the printed words werefastened I made a close inspection for the water-mark. In doingso I held it within a few inches of my eyes, and was conscious ofa faint smell of the scent known as white jessamine. There areseventy-five perfumes, which it is very necessary that a criminalexpert should be able to distinguish from each other, and caseshave more than once within my own experience depended upon theirprompt recognition. The scent suggested the presence of a lady,and already my thoughts began to turn towards the Stapletons.Thus I had made certain of the hound, and had guessed at thecriminal before ever we went to the west country."It was my game to watch Stapleton. It was evident, however, thatI could not do this if I were with you, since he would be keenlyon his guard. I deceived everybody, therefore, yourself included,and I came down secretly when I was supposed to be in London. Myhardships were not so great as you imagined, though such triflingdetails must never interfere with the investigation of a case. Istayed for the most part at Coombe Tracey, and only used the hutupon the moor when it was necessary to be near the scene ofaction. Cartwright had come down with me, and in his disguise asa country boy he was of great assistance to me. I was dependentupon him for food and clean linen. When I was watching Stapleton,Cartwright was frequently watching you, so that I was able tokeep my hand upon all the strings."I have already told you that your reports reached me rapidly,being forwarded instantly from Baker Street to Coombe Tracey.They were of great service to me, and especially that oneincidentally truthful piece of biography of Stapleton's. I wasable to establish the identity of the man and the woman and knewat last exactly how I stood. The case had been considerablycomplicated through the incident of the escaped convict and therelations between him and the Barrymores. This also you clearedup in a very effective way, though I had already come to the sameconclusions from my own observations."By the time that you discovered me upon the moor I had acomplete knowledge of the whole business, but I had not a casewhich could go to a jury. Even Stapleton's attempt upon Sir Henrythat night which ended in the death of the unfortunate convictdid not help us much in proving murder against our man. Thereseemed to be no alternative but to catch him red-handed, and todo so we had to use Sir Henry, alone and apparently unprotected,as a bait. We did so, and at the cost of a severe shock to ourclient we succeeded in completing our case and driving Stapletonto his destruction. That Sir Henry should have been exposed tothis is, I must confess, a reproach to my management of the case,but we had no means of foreseeing the terrible and paralyzingspectacle which the beast presented, nor could we predict the fogwhich enabled him to burst upon us at such short notice. Wesucceeded in our object at a cost which both the specialist andDr. Mortimer assure me will be a temporary one. A long journeymay enable our friend to recover not only from his shatterednerves but also from his wounded feelings. His love for the ladywas deep and sincere, and to him the saddest part of all thisblack business was that he should have been deceived by her."It only remains to indicate the part which she had playedthroughout. There can be no doubt that Stapleton exercised aninfluence over her which may have been love or may have beenfear, or very possibly both, since they are by no meansincompatible emotions. It was, at least, absolutely effective. Athis command she consented to pass as his sister, though he foundthe limits of his power over her when he endeavoured to make herthe direct accessory to murder. She was ready to warn Sir Henryso far as she could without implicating her husband, and againand again she tried to do so. Stapleton himself seems to havebeen capable of jealousy, and when he saw the baronet payingcourt to the lady, even though it was part of his own plan, stillhe could not help interrupting with a passionate outburst whichrevealed the fiery soul which his self-contained manner socleverly concealed. By encouraging the intimacy he made itcertain that Sir Henry would frequently come to Merripit Houseand that he would sooner or later get the opportunity which hedesired. On the day of the crisis, however, his wife turnedsuddenly against him. She had learned something of the death ofthe convict, and she knew that the hound was being kept in theouthouse on the evening that Sir Henry was coming to dinner. Shetaxed her husband with his intended crime, and a furious scenefollowed in which he showed her for the first time that she had arival in his love. Her fidelity turned in an instant to bitterhatred, and he saw that she would betray him. He tied her up,therefore, that she might have no chance of warning Sir Henry,and he hoped, no doubt, that when the whole countryside put downthe baronet's death to the curse of his family, as they certainlywould do, he could win his wife back to accept an accomplishedfact and to keep silent upon what she knew. In this I fancy thatin any case he made a miscalculation, and that, if we had notbeen there, his doom would none the less have been sealed. Awoman of Spanish blood does not condone such an injury solightly. And now, my dear Watson, without referring to my notes,I cannot give you a more detailed account of this curious case. Ido not know that anything essential has been left unexplained.""He could not hope to frighten Sir Henry to death as he had donethe old uncle with his bogie hound.""The beast was savage and half-starved. If its appearance did notfrighten its victim to death, at least it would paralyze theresistance which might be offered.""No doubt. There only remains one difficulty. If Stapleton cameinto the succession, how could he explain the fact that he, theheir, had been living unannounced under another name so close tothe property? How could he claim it without causing suspicion andinquiry?""It is a formidable difficulty, and I fear that you ask too muchwhen you expect me to solve it. The past and the present arewithin the field of my inquiry, but what a man may do in thefuture is a hard question to answer. Mrs. Stapleton has heard herhusband discuss the problem on several occasions. There werethree possible courses. He might claim the property from SouthAmerica, establish his identity before the British authoritiesthere and so obtain the fortune without ever coming to England atall, or he might adopt an elaborate disguise during the shorttime that he need be in London; or, again, he might furnish anaccomplice with the proofs and papers, putting him in as heir,and retaining a claim upon some proportion of his income. Wecannot doubt from what we know of him that he would have foundsome way out of the difficulty. And now, my dear Watson, we havehad some weeks of severe work, and for one evening, I think, wemay turn our thoughts into more pleasant channels. I have a boxfor _Les Huguenots_. Have you heard the De Reszkes? Might Itrouble you then to be ready in half an hour, and we can stop atMarcini's for a little dinner on the way?"THE END
